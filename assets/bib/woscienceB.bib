Abstract = {A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
   towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content
   detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it
   requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women.
   To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection
   of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three
   modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature
   Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning
   Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal
   context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual
   and textual information and generating contextually relevant features.
   The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
   modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific
   features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally,
   we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific
   lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature
   space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The
   performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two
   multimodal datasets, MAMI, and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples,
   respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of
   11.87\% and 10.82\% in macro-F1 over existing multimodal methods on the
   MAMI and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.},

Title = {A Linear Systems Perspective on Intrusion Detection for Routing in
   Reconfigurable Wireless Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {60486-60500},
Abstract = {Reconfigurable wireless networks, such as ad hoc or wireless sensor
   networks, do not rely on fixed infrastructure. Nodes must cooperate in
   the multi-hop routing process. This dynamic and open nature make
   reconfigurable networks vulnerable to routing attacks that could degrade
   significantly network performance. Intrusion detection systems consist
   of a set of techniques designed to identify hostile behavior. In this
   paper, there are several approaches for intrusion detection in
   reconfigurable network routing such as collaborative, statistical, or
   machine learning-based techniques. In this paper, we introduce a new
   approach to intrusion detection for reconfigurable network routing based
   on linear systems theory. Using this approach, we can discriminate
   routing attacks by considering the system's z-plane poles. The z-plane
   can be thought of as a two dimensional feature space that arises
   naturally. It is independent of the number of network attack detection
   metrics and does not require extra dimensionality reduction. Two
   different host-based intrusion detection techniques, inspired by this
   new linear systems perspective, are presented and analyzed through a
   case study. The case study considers the effects of attack severity and
   node mobility to the attack detection performance. High attack detection
   accuracy was obtained without increasing packet overhead for both
   techniques by analyzing locally available information.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for automatically detecting the
   presence of hate speech within the terrorist argument. Hate speech can
   be used by a terrorist group as a means of judging possible targets'
   guilt and deciding on their punishment, as well as a means of making
   people to accept acts of terror or even as propaganda for possibly
   attracting new members. In this paper, we examine both ideology
   expressed and practices employed by the Revolutionary Organization 17
   November (hereafter 17N) that operated in Greece between the years of
   1975 and 2002. Within this line of thought, we will focus on the
   ideological justification, ethical standing and deployment of the
   terrorist operations as presented in the communiques published by 17N,
   emphasizing on the use of hate speech as a means of justifying their
   choices and actions, as well as a way of reaching out to Greek people.
   To decide on how the automatic classification will be performed, we
   experimented with different text analyzing techniques such as critical
   discourse and content analysis and based on the preliminary results of
   these techniques a classification algorithm is proposed that can
   classify the communiques in three categories depending on the presence
   of hate speech. The methodology was tested over the existing dataset
   with all the communiques and the corresponding results are discussed.},

Title = {The ripple effect of dataset reuse: Contextualising the data lifecycle
   for machine learning data sets and social impact},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 27},
Abstract = {Although there exists a rich literature on data lifecycle, a common
   framework for data lifecycle depicts reuse as the last stage. However,
   this framework fails to explain the complex lifecycle of machine
   learning (ML) data sets, which can have many different afterlives. Data
   sets for ML can be expanded to supplement previous research, and
   researchers can concatenate multiple data sets to develop new models.
   This study discusses ML dataset reuse through the lens of the
   data-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid. In social science research,
   researchers might reuse data to analyse a new research question that is
   still in the context of the data domain. By contrast, research practices
   in ML, where researchers layer multiple data sets for training purposes,
   require us to ask whether the existing data lifecycle model, ending with
   `reuse', is appropriate for explaining such an iterative and layered
   lifecycle. This study introduces one case of merging computer vision
   data set and natural language processing data set and two cases of
   applying ML models from outside of the ML community (hate speech
   detection and politeness detection) to justify a framework for a ML
   dataset lifecycle. Last but not least, this study proposes a ML dataset
   lifecycle and provides case examples to describe each stage.},

Abstract = {Mobile devices and social networks provide communication opportunities
   among the young generation, which increases vulnerability and
   cybercrimes activities. A recent survey reports that cyberbullying and
   cyberstalking constitute a developing issue among youngsters. This paper
   focuses on cyberbullying detection in mobile phone text by retrieving
   with the help of an oxygen forensics toolkit. We describe the data
   collection using forensics technique and a corpus of suspicious
   activities like cyberbullying annotation from mobile phones and carry
   out a sequence of binary classification experiments to determine
   cyberbullying detection. We use forensics techniques, Machine Learning
   (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to exploit suspicious patterns
   to help the forensics investigation where every evidence contributes to
   the case. Experiments on a real-time dataset reveal better results for
   the detection of cyberbullying content. The Random Forest in ML approach
   produces 87\% of accuracy without SMOTE technique, whereas the value of
   F1 Score produces a good result with SMOTE technique. The LSTM has 92\%
   of validation accuracy in the DL algorithm compared with Dense and
   BiLSTM algorithms.},

Abstract = {According to extraordinary growth of network-based services, intrusion
   detection has been introduced as an important and efficient issue in the
   direction of network's security promotion. In order for coping with the
   infiltrators of networks and computerized systems, different methods
   have been codified which are called intrusion detection method the aim
   of which is that illegal usage and abuse and damaging the systems and
   computerized networks is recognized by both internal users and external
   attackers. Generally, intrusion detection methods are divided in to two
   main categories of abuse detection and abnormal behavior detection. In
   abuse detection method, known intrusion patterns are used for
   recognizing the intrusions but in abnormal behavior detection methods,
   normal behavior of the users has the main criterion. As a result, any
   inconsistent behavior with that is considered as an effort for
   permeating the system. In this paper, intrusion detection systems and
   their performance are considered and finally we will become familiar
   with intrusion detection methods including data mining algorithms.},

Title = {Relating conversational topics and toxic behavior effects in a MOBA game},
Journal = {ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {10-29},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are very competitive and
   victory relies on effective teamwork. Toxic behavior is a common
   concern, as it corrodes team effort and harms game ambiance. Related
   work has focused on the automatic detection of toxic behavior, mostly
   based on features from the communication channels used by players. In
   this paper, we investigate the conversational patterns used by players
   of a popular MOBA game, League of Legends, and their effects on
   performance and contamination. We identify the main conversation topics
   exchanged by players using in-game chats; characterize the behavior of
   each type of player according to these topics; and develop an in-depth
   analysis of how they affect game performance and toxic contamination.
   Our findings show that some topics are directly related to toxic
   behavior. The allies of a toxic player are in general more affected by
   toxic behavior than the opponents, and in some cases, they act together
   as a source of toxic behavior. Opponents are more affected when the
   toxic behavior is directly targeted at them (e.g. racist slurs). Players
   with no significant contact with toxic players tend to be more positive,
   concentrating on game tactics and socialization.},

Title = {Generalizing Hate Speech Detection Using Multi-Task Learning: A Case
   Study of Political Public Figures},
Journal = {COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Automatic identification of hateful and abusive content is vital in
   combating the spread of harmful online content and its damaging effects.
   Most existing works evaluate models by examining the generalization
   error on train-test splits on hate speech datasets. These datasets often
   differ in their definitions and labeling criteria, leading to poor
   generalization performance when predicting across new domains and
   datasets. This work proposes a new Multi-task Learning (MTL) pipeline
   that trains simultaneously across multiple hate speech datasets to
   construct a more encompassing classification model. Using a
   dataset-level leave- one-out evaluation (designating a dataset for
   testing and jointly training on all others), we trial the MTL detection
   on new, previously unseen datasets. Our results consistently outperform
   a large sample of existing work. We show strong results when examining
   the generalization error in train-test splits and substantial
   improvements when predicting on previously unseen datasets. Furthermore,
   we assemble a novel dataset, dubbed PUBFIGS, , focusing on the
   problematic speech of American Public Political Figures. We
   crowdsource-label using Amazon MTurk more than 20,000 tweets and
   machine-label problematic speech in all the 305,235 tweets in PUBFIGS. .
   We find that the abusive and hate tweeting mainly originates from
   right-leaning figures and relates to six topics, including Islam, women,
   ethnicity, and immigrants. We show that MTL builds embeddings that can
   simultaneously separate abusive from hate speech, and identify its
   topics.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is a crime where one person becomes the target of
   harassment and hate. Many cyberbullying detection approaches have been
   introduced, however, they were largely based on textual and user
   features. Most of the research found in the literature aimed at
   improving detection through introducing new features. However, as the
   number of features increases, the feature extraction and selection
   phases have become harder. On the other hand, no study has examined the
   meaning of words and semantics in cyberbullying. In order to bridge this
   gap, we propose a novel algorithms CNN-CB that eliminate the need for
   feature engineering and produce better prediction than traditional
   cyberbullying detection approaches. The proposed algorithm adapts the
   concept of word embedding where similar words have similar embedding.
   Therefore, bullying tweets will have similar representations and this
   will advance the detection. CNN-CB is based on convolutional neural
   network (CNN) and incorporates semantics through the use of word
   embedding. Experiments showed that CNN-CB algorithm outperform
   traditional content-based cyberbullying detection with an accuracy of
   95\%.},

Abstract = {The field of the automatic detection of hate speech and related concepts
   has raised a lot of interest in the last years. Different datasets were
   annotated and classified by means of applying different machine learning
   algorithms. However, few efforts were done in order to clarify the
   applied categories and homogenize different datasets. Our study takes up
   this demand. We analyze six different publicly available datasets in
   this field with respect to their similarity and compatibility. We
   conduct two different experiments. First, we try to make the datasets
   compatible and represent the dataset classes as Fast Text word vectors
   analyzing the similarity between different classes in a intra and inter
   dataset manner. Second, we submit the chosen datasets to the Perspective
   API Toxicity classifier, achieving different performances depending on
   the categories and datasets. One of the main conclusions of these
   experiments is that many different definitions are being used for
   equivalent concepts, which makes most of the publicly available datasets
   incompatible. Grounded in our analysis, we provide guidelines for future
   dataset collection and annotation.},

Abstract = {The role of explanations in intelligent systems has in the last few
   years entered the spotlight as AI-based solutions appear in an
   ever-growing set of applications. Though data-driven (or machine
   learning) techniques are often used as examples of how opaque (also
   called black box) approaches can lead to problems such as bias and
   general lack of explainability and interpretability, in reality these
   features are difficult to tame in general, even for approaches that are
   based on tools typically considered to be more amenable, like
   knowledge-based formalisms. In this paper, we continue a line of
   research and development towards building tools that facilitate the
   implementation of explainable and interpretable hybrid intelligent
   socio-technical systems, focusing on features that users can leverage to
   build explanations to their queries. In particular, we present the
   implementation of a recently-proposed application framework (and make
   available its source code) for developing such systems, and explore
   user-centered mechanisms for building explanations based both on the
   kinds of explanations required (such as counterfactual, contextual,
   etc.) and the inputs used for building them (coming from various
   sources, such as the knowledge base and lower-level data-driven
   modules). In order to validate our approach, we develop two use cases,
   one as a running example for detecting hate speech in social platforms
   and the other as an extension that also contemplates cyberbullying
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {This article tackles the problem of sentiment analysis in the Arabic
   language where a new deep learning model has been put forward. The
   proposed model uses a hybrid bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU)
   and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) additive-attention
   model where the Bidirectional GRU/LSTM reads the individual sentence
   input from left to right and vice versa, enabling the capture of the
   contextual information. However, the model is trained on two types of
   embeddings: FastText and local learnable embeddings. The BiLSTM and
   BiGRU architectures are put into competition to identify the best
   hyperparameter set for the model. The developed model has been tested on
   three large-scale commonly employed Arabic sentiment dataset:
   large-scale Arabic Book Reviews Dataset (ABRD), Hotel Arabic-Reviews
   Dataset (HARD), and Books Reviews in the Arabic Dataset (BRAD). The
   testing results demonstrate that our model outperforms both the baseline
   models and the state-of-the-art models reported in the original
   references of these datasets, achieving accuracy scores of 98.6\%,
   96.19\%, 95.65\% for LARB, HARD, and BRAD, respectively. Furthermore, to
   demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our model, the
   performances of the model have been evaluated on three other natural
   language processing tasks: news categorization, offensive speech
   detection, and Russian sentiment analysis. The results demonstrated the
   developed model is language- and task-independent, which offers new
   perspectives for the application of the developed models in several
   other natural language processing challenges.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of detecting violent behaviors in
   surveillance cameras, requests on systems that automatically recognize
   violent events are expanded. Nowadays, violence detection has become an
   active research field in image processing and machine learning. The
   relevant works in such a field are classified into hand-crafted and deep
   learning methods. Despite the effectiveness of hand-crafted ones, their
   computational cost may be suppressive for practical applications.
   Additionally, deep learning techniques usually exploit 3D Convolutional
   Networks (3D ConvNets) to do this task. To improve the accuracy of these
   networks, meaningful regions and temporal changes in videos should be
   considered. Consequently, the performance of a 3D ConvNet can be
   reinforced by selecting significant temporal information and noticing to
   special regions in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose a
   novel 3D ConvNet along with a technique for extracting interest frames.
   The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is exploited to extract
   interest frames as significant temporal information. Indeed, the SSIM
   uses the statistical features of two consecutive frames for this reason.
   In this way, sixteen video frames with the smallest SSIM are considered
   as dominant motion frames, which are then sent to a 3D CNN for
   classification. Moreover, a spatial attention module is exploited to
   make attention on the specific regions. Furthermore, three benchmark
   datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method. The results show that in terms of accuracy, our scheme
   outperforms existing approaches.},

Abstract = {Accessibility to the internet has led to a massive increase in the usage
   of social networking and online communication apps over the past decade.
   With so much content available online, these platforms suffer from
   governance and monitoring problems making the users susceptible to
   online cyberbullying and trolling. Recently, this trolling and hate
   comes majorly from memes that combine text and image modalities. Many
   studies show how cyberbullying can harm the mental well-being of the
   affected individuals. Previous studies also tried to study the role of
   sentiment, emotions, and sarcasm in identifying hateful memes setting up
   the meme detection task as a multi-modal, multitask problem. In the
   past, meme detection models were discriminative, but more recently
   generative models have been used to solve non-generation tasks such as
   aspect-based sentiment analysis and span detection. Motivated by this,
   in this work, we propose a unified Multimodal Generative framework, MGex
   by reframing the multitasking problem of detecting cyberbullying,
   sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm as a multimodal text-to-text generation
   problem. For this purpose, we use MultiBully dataset which provides
   annotation for all these labels. Here, we evaluate and contrast our
   proposed generative framework with several multitasking baselines and

Abstract = {In the era of social networking platforms, user-generated content is
   flooding every second on online social media platforms like Facebook. So
   observing and identifying many contents, including threats and sexual
   harassment, are more accessible than traditional media. Online content
   with extreme toxicity can lead to online harassment, profanity, personal
   attacks, and bullying acts. As Bangla is the seventh most spoken
   language worldwide, the utilization of Bangla language in Facebook has
   raised current times. The use of abusive comments on Facebook with
   Bangla also has increased alarmingly, but the research regarding this is
   very low. In this research work, we concentrate on identifying abusive
   comments of Bangla language in social media (Facebook) that can filter
   out at the primitive stage of social media's affixing. To classify
   abusive comments swiftly and precisely, we apply transformer-based deep
   neural network models. We employ pre-training language architectures,
   BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and
   ELECTRA (Efficiency Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token
   Replacements Accurately). We have conducted this work with a novel
   dataset comprises 44,001 comments from multitudinous Facebook posts. In
   this classification process, we have exhibited an average accuracy,
   precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate our proposed models. The
   outcomes have brought a percipience of our applied BERT and ELECTRA
   architecture that performs notably with 85.00\% and 84.92\% test
   accuracy, respectively.},

Abstract = {Social media is a great source of communication. People use various
   social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, for
   sharing their ideas, opinions, and feelings. Users of different age
   groups, cultures, education backgrounds manipulate these powerful
   mediums of communication. Even though it gives all the benefits of
   knowledge sharing among the users, it has a dark side too. Despite
   setting restrictions from the corresponding sites, many users use
   abusive language to blemish the status and image of someone. So it is
   highly the need of the hour for the government or the particular social
   media platform to sift out those unwanted hate texts before diffusing
   them. Finding the hate text is one of the emerging research topics in
   Natural Language Processing where the model predicts the given text as
   hate text or not. This automated hate text detection becomes tedious
   when we consider the Indian languages due to a lack of data. Moreover,
   Indian people are multilingual and use code-mixed patterns to express
   their thoughts. The unavailability of the annotated Tamil-English
   dataset and the lack of a standard model make this task more
   challenging. In our paper, to handle such code-mixed data, a dataset is
   created with 10000 Tamil-English code-mixed texts collected from
   Twitter. These are annotated as hate text/non-hate text. In this paper,
   we use a synonym-based Bi-LSTM model for classifying hate non-hate text
   in tweets.},

Abstract = {Online social networks(OSNs) facilitate their users in real-time
   communication but also open the door for several challenging problems
   like hate speech and fake news. This study discusses hate speech on OSNs
   and presents an automatic method to identify hate messages. We introduce
   an attentional multi-channel convolutional-BiLSTM network for the
   classification of hateful content. Our model uses existing word
   representation techniques in a multi-channel environment having several
   filters with different kernel sizes to capture semantics relations at
   various windows. The encoded representation from multiple channels
   passes through an attention-aware stacked 2-layer BiLSTM network. The
   output from stacked 2-layer BiLSTM is weighted by an attention layer and
   further concatenated and passes via a dense layer. Finally, an output
   layer employing a sigmoid function classifies the text. We investigate
   the efficacy of the presented model on three Twitter-related benchmark
   datasets considering four evaluation metrics. In comparative evaluation,
   our model beats the five state-of-the-art and the same number of
   baseline models. The ablation study shows that the exclusion of channels
   and attention mechanism has the highest impact on the performance of the
   presented model. The empirical analysis analyzing the impact of
   different word representation techniques, optimization algorithms,
   activation functions, and batch size on the presented model ascertains
   the use of their optimal values.},

Abstract = {In social-media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, people
   prefer to use code-mixed language such as Spanish-English, Hindi-English
   to express their opinions. In this paper, we describe different models
   we used, using the external dataset to train embeddings, ensembling
   methods for Sentimix, and OffensEval tasks. The use of pre-trained
   embeddings usually helps in multiple tasks such as sentence
   classification, and machine translation. In this experiment, we have
   used our trained code-mixed embeddings and twitter pre-trained
   embeddings to SemEval tasks. We evaluate our models on macro F1-score,
   precision, accuracy, and recall on the datasets. We intend to show that
   hyper-parameter tuning and data pre-processing steps help a lot in
   improving the scores. In our experiments, we are able to achieve 0.886
   F1-Macro on OffenEval Greek language subtask post-evaluation, whereas
   the highest is 0.852 during the Evaluation Period. We stood third in
   Spanglish competition with our best F1-score of 0.756. Codalab username

Abstract = {GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of 110
   rhetorical figures in the German language. The overall goal of building
   an ontology of rhetorical figures in German is not only the formal
   representation of different rhetorical figures, but also allowing for
   their easier detection, thus improving sentiment analysis, argument
   mining, detection of hate speech and fake news, machine translation, and
   many other tasks in which recognition of non-literal language plays an
   important role. The challenge of building such ontologies lies in
   classifying the figures and assigning adequate characteristics to group
   them, while considering their distinctive features. The ontology of
   rhetorical figures in the Serbian language was used as a basis for our
   work. Besides transferring and extending the concepts of the Serbian
   ontology, we ensured completeness and consistency by using description
   logic and SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we show a decision tree to
   identify figures and suggest a usage scenario on how the ontology can be
   utilized to collect and annotate data.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying has become a big issue with the popularity of different
   social media networks and online communication apps. While plenty of
   research is going on to develop better models for cyberbullying
   detection in monolingual language, there is very little research on the
   code-mixed languages and explainability aspect of cyberbullying. Recent
   laws like ``right to explanations{''} of General Data Protection
   Regulation, have spurred research in developing interpretable models
   rather than focusing on performance. Motivated by this we develop the
   first interpretable multi-task model called mExCB for automatic
   cyberbullying detection from code-mixed languages which can
   simultaneously solve several tasks, cyberbullying detection,
   explanation/rationale identification, target group detection and
   sentiment analysis. We have introduced BullyExplain, the first benchmark
   dataset for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed language.
   Each post in BullyExplain dataset is annotated with four labels, i.e.,
   bully label, sentiment label, target and rationales (explainability),
   i.e., which phrases are being responsible for annotating the post as a
   bully. The proposed multitask framework (mExCB) based on CNN and GRU
   with word and sub-sentence (SS) level attention is able to outperform
   several baselines and state of the art models when applied on
   BullyExplain dataset.},

Title = {Multimodal Hate Speech Detection in Memes Using Contrastive
   Language-Image Pre-Training},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {In contemporary society, the proliferation of online hateful messages
   has emerged as a pressing concern, inflicting deleterious consequences
   on both societal fabric and individual well-being. The automatic
   detection of such malevolent content online using models designed to
   recognize it, holds promise in mitigating its harmful impact. However,
   the advent of ``Hateful Memes{''} poses fresh challenges to the
   detection paradigm, particularly within the realm of deep learning
   models. These memes, constituting of a textual element associated with
   an image are individually innocuous but their combination causes a
   detrimental effect. Consequently, entities responsible for disseminating
   information via web browsers are compelled to institute mechanisms that
   regulate and automatically filter out such injurious content.
   Effectively identifying hateful memes demands algorithms and models
   endowed with robust vision and language fusion capabilities, capable of
   reasoning across diverse modalities. This research introduces a novel
   approach by leveraging the multimodal Contrastive Language-Image
   Pre-Training (CLIP) model, fine-tuned through the incorporation of
   prompt engineering. This innovative methodology achieves a commendable
   accuracy of 87.42\%. Comprehensive metrics such as loss, AUROC, and f1
   score are also meticulously computed, corroborating the efficacy of the
   proposed strategy. Our findings suggest that this approach presents an
   efficient means to regulate the dissemination of hate speech in the form
   of viral meme content across social networking platforms, thereby
   contributing to a safer online environment.},

Abstract = {Hate speech is demonstrably aimed at social tension and violence.
   Detection becomes increasingly difficult as overlapping emotional
   feelings occur. However, there are still several unresolved issues with
   informal and indirect targeting of negative communication, including
   sarcasm, misrepresentation, and praise for the target's or society's
   immoral behavior. In this study, we proposed a method for instance
   selection based on attention network visualization. The goal is to
   categorize, modify, and expand the number of training instances. To this
   end, we first used the lexicons of hate speech and online forums to
   train the embedding using transfer learning. Then, we used synonym
   expansion to the semantic vectors. The active learning approach was used
   to train the task using the result-label pairs. The entropy-based
   selection and visualization techniques help select unlabeled text for
   each active learning cycle. The approach is improved, and the number of
   training instances is increased to improve the model's accuracy. The
   active learning cycles are repeated until all unlabeled texts are
   converted to labeled text. The semantic embedding and lexicon expansion
   improve the model receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) from 0.89 to
   0.91. The bidirectional LSTM with attention and active learning achieved
   0.90 for precision-recall. The learned model can visualize the
   position-weighted terms to illustrate why hate speech is classified.},

Abstract = {Machine Learning (ML), among other things, facilitates Text
   Classification, the task of assigning classes to textual items.
   Classification performance in ML has been significantly improved due to
   recent developments, including the rise of Recurrent Neural Networks
   (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and
   Transformer Models. Internal memory states with dynamic temporal
   behavior can be found in these kinds of cells. This temporal behavior in
   the LSTM cell is stored in two different states: ``Current{''} and
   ``Hidden{''}. In this work, we define a modification layer within the
   LSTM cell which allows us to perform additional state adjustments for
   either state, or even simultaneously alter both. We perform 17 state
   alterations. Out of these 17 single-state alteration experiments, 12
   involve the Current state whereas five involve the Hidden one. These
   alterations are evaluated using seven datasets related to sentiment
   analysis, document classification, hate speech detection, and
   human-to-robot interaction. Our results showed that the highest
   performing alteration for Current and Hidden state can achieve an
   average F1 improvement of 0.5\% and 0.3\%, respectively. We also compare
   our modified cell performance to two Transformer models, where our
   modified LSTM cell is outperformed in classification metrics in 4/6
   datasets, but improves upon the simple Transformer model and clearly has
   a better cost efficiency than both Transformer models.},

Title = {Detecting Disseminators of Hate Speech by Optimizing Textual and
   User-Based Features},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},

Month = {2024 OCT 1},
Abstract = {Hate speech through online social media is on the rise, which has
   attracted researchers across the world to develop models to control its
   circulation to create better and smarter society. Although several
   models have been reported to recognize hate speech in the most widely
   spoken language, the issue has not yet been deemed to be under control.
   Very few academics have built models to identify hate speech spreaders
   so that the problem can be managed at the source by correctly filtering
   their posts. In this article, we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) to
   extract features from user-posted text-tweet and Tweepy to extract
   behavior-based features. The LSTM-based textual feature extracted from
   text-tweet and user behavior based features extracted from the Twitter
   user's profile are concatenated and further optimized with camel
   algorithm (CA) to yield more pertinent features. The optimized feature
   vector is used to determine whether or not a user is a hate spreader
   using machine learning classifiers. The developed model is validated
   with the dataset provided by the PAN 2021 and PAN-2020
   (https://pan.webis.de/data.html) hate speech spreader profiling and
   FakeNews spreader profiling challenge, respectively. Our proposed model
   outperforms the state-of-the-art models, with an accuracy of 96\% for
   PAN 2021 and 94\% for PAN 2020 for English and Spanish datasets,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {For years, social media platforms have been used to incite violence
   towards minority groups using hate speech or writing that express
   pejorative or discriminatory language undermining gender, ethnicity,
   religion, or nationality. In this article, we assembled a multi-class
   dataset of 83,360 tweets, which include four hate classes and one
   non-hate class. We adopted three popular machine learning and deep
   learning models, such as SVM, long short-term memory model extended with
   an attention mechanism (LSTM-Attention), and BERT model for the
   classification of those hate tweets. Our experiments show that for the
   identification of religious-hate tweets, LSTM-Attention model
   consistently produced the best performance, while for other two types of
   hate tweets, such as sexist and racist, we observed that on average BERT
   produces the best result. Both the LSTM-Attention and BERT reached an
   overall F1-score of 90\% and 91\% respectively for multi-label
   classification. Our detail analysis reveals that since sexist or racist
   tweets make use of more hate or slang words than that of religious-hate
   tweets, BERT performs better in detecting the first two classes.
   However, since many of religious-hate tweets not necessarily include any
   disparaging words, BERT failed to identify those hate speeches. Thus,
   LSTM-Attention was used to extract the words with higher attention
   weights to identify which words matter the most for the classification
   of hate speech. We show that words that carry more predictive
   information for the hate tweets classification are not necessarily high
   frequency or hateful words.},

Abstract = {Automating hate speech or inappropriate text detection in social media
   and other internet platforms is gaining a lot of interest and becoming a
   valuable research topic for both industry and academia in recent years.
   It is more important for applications to identify the disruptive
   contents, understand sentiment analysis, identify cyber bullying, detect
   flames, threats, hatred towards people or particular communities or
   groups etc. Text classification is a very challenging task due to the
   nature and complexities with languages, especially its context, micro
   words, emojis, typo error and sarcasm present in the text. In this
   paper, we have proposed a model with a novel approach for generating
   hybrid features for an effective feature representation to classify hate
   speech. We have combined features learned from deep learning methods
   with the semantic features like word n- grams and tweets specific
   syntactic features to form hybrid feature sets. We have also improvised
   preprocessing steps to reduce the number of missing embeddings to
   increase the vocabulary for efficient feature learning. We have
   experimented with the various neural networks for feature learning and
   machine learning models with hybrid features for classification. Our
   work delivers hybrid features and appropriate preprocessing techniques
   for an efficient classification of the standard dataset of 16k annotated
   hate speech tweets. The combination of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
   trained on Random Embeddings for deep learning features extraction and
   Logistic Regression (LR) as a classifier with the hybrid features is
   found to be the best model and it outperforms the state of the art
   reported in the literature.},

Abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) is a prominent task in identifying text
   spans to specific types. Named entity boundary detection can be
   mentioned as a rising research area under NER. Although a limited work
   has been conducted for nested NE boundary detection, flat NE boundary
   detection can be considered as at a pinnacle stage. Nested NE boundary
   detection is an important aspect in information extraction, information
   retrieval, event extraction, sentiment analysis etc. On the other hand,
   spreading religious unhealthy statements through social media has become
   a burden for the wellbeing of the society. The prime objective of this
   research is to implement a novel system for nested NE boundary detection
   for Sinhala language considering religious unhealthy statements in
   social media. A constructive literature survey has been conducted for
   analyzing the already developed NE type and boundary detection
   approaches and systems. Along with that, identifying the linguistic
   structures and patterns of Sinhala hate speech detection has been
   conducted. A corpus of more than 100,000 Sinhala hates speech contents
   have been extracted, preprocessed, and annotated by an expert panel.
   Then, a deep neural approach has been applied for capturing the
   complexity indexes, matrices, and other related elements of the corpus.
   Next, a novel approach called ``boundary bubbles{''} has been conducted
   for capturing word representation, head word detection, entity mention
   nuggets identification and region classification for NE boundary
   detection. Experiments reveal that our scientific novel approach has
   achieved the state-of-art performance over the existing baselines.},

Abstract = {Successful prevention of cyberbullying depends on the adequate detection
   of harmful messages. Given the impossibility of human moderation on the
   Social Web, intelligent systems are required to identify clues of
   cyberbullying automatically. Much work on cyberbullying detection
   focuses on detecting abusive language without analyzing the severity of
   the event nor the participants involved. Automatic analysis of
   participant roles in cyberbullying traces enables targeted bullying
   prevention strategies. In this paper, we aim to automatically detect
   different participant roles involved in textual cyberbullying traces,
   including bullies, victims, and bystanders. We describe the construction
   of two cyberbullying corpora (a Dutch and English corpus) that were both
   manually annotated with bullying types and participant roles and we
   perform a series of multiclass classification experiments to determine
   the feasibility of text-based cyberbullying participant role detection.
   The representative datasets present a data imbalance problem for which
   we investigate feature filtering and data resampling as skew mitigation
   techniques. We investigate the performance of feature-engineered single
   and ensemble classifier setups as well as transformer-based pretrained
   language models (PLMs). Cross-validation experiments revealed promising
   results for the detection of cyberbullying roles using PLM fine-tuning
   techniques, with the best classifier for English (RoBERTa) yielding a
   macro-averaged F-1-score of 55.84\%, and the best one for Dutch
   (RobBERT) yielding an F,-score of 56.73\%. Experiment replication data
   and source code are available at https://osf.io/nb2r3.},

Abstract = {We investigate the performance of a state-of-the-art (SoTA) architecture
   T5 (available on the SuperGLUE) and compare it with 3 other previous
   SoTA architectures across 5 different tasks from 2 relatively diverse
   datasets. The datasets are diverse in terms of the number and types of
   tasks they have To improve performance, we augment the training data by
   using a new autoregressive conversational AI model checkpoint. We
   achieve near-SoTA results on a couple of the tasks - macro F1 scores of
   81.66\% for task A of the OLID 2019 dataset and 82.54\% for task A of
   the hate speech and offensive content (HASOC) 2021 dataset, where SoTA
   are 82.9\% and 83.05\%, respectively. We perform error analysis and
   explain why one of the models (Bi-LSTM) makes the predictions it does by
   using a publicly available algorithm: Integrated Gradient (IG). This is
   because explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for
   earning the trust of users. The main contributions of this work are the
   implementation method of T5, which is discussed; the data augmentation,
   which brought performance improvements; and the revelation on the
   shortcomings of the HASOC 2021 dataset. The revelation shows the
   difficulties of poor data annotation by using a small set of examples
   where the T5 model made the correct predictions, even when the ground
   truth of the test set were incorrect (in our opinion). We also provide
   our model checkpoints on the HuggingFace hub(1).},

Abstract = {The growing popularity of online platforms that allow users to
   communicate with each other, exchange opinions about various events and
   leave comments, has contributed to the development of natural language
   processing algorithms. Tens of millions of messages per day published by
   users of a certain social network must be analyzed in real time for
   moderation to prevent the spread of various illegal or offensive
   information, threats and other types of toxic comments. Of course, such
   a large amount of information can be processed quite quickly only
   automatically. That is why it is necessary to find a way to teach a
   computer to ``understand{''} a text written by a man. It is a
   non-trivial task, even if the word ``understand{''} here means only to
   detect or classify. The rapid development of machine learning
   technologies has led to the widespread adoption of new algorithms. Many
   tasks that for years were considered almost impossible to solve using
   computer now can be successfully solved with deep learning technologies.
   In this article, the author presents modern approaches to solving the
   problem of toxic comments detection using deep learning technologies and
   neural networks. The author introduces two state-of-the-art neural
   network architectures and also demonstrates how to use a contextual
   language representation model to detect toxicity. Furthermore, in this
   article will be presented the results of the developed algorithms, as
   well as the results of their ensemble, tested on a large training set,
   gathered and marked up by Google and Jigsaw.},

Abstract = {Children and adults with special needs may find it difficult to
   recognize danger and threats as well as socially complex situations.
   Thus, they are under the risk of being victims of exploitation, violence
   and attacks. In addition, they may find themselves unintendedly
   insulting their friends, relatives or caregivers. In this paper, we
   propose an autonomous agent to assist the special needs person (child or
   adult) in the goal of recognizing risky or insulting situations. The
   autonomous agent will detect these situations and will signal them to
   the user (by text, speech, or other signaling forms). We composed a
   dataset containing 13,490 sentences, categorized into one of four
   classes: a `normal' sentence, an insulting sentence, a negative sentence
   about a different person, or a risky sentence that may indicate a
   dangerous situation for the special needs person, which requires
   immediate intervention. We used several machine learning methods, and we
   found that the most accurate methods were the random forest method with
   100 estimators, a voting method using several classifiers, and a
   convolutional neural network (CNN) with embedding. All of these
   mechanisms reached an accuracy close to 70\% in classifying the
   sentences in the test set. Finally, using an ensemble method comprising
   a panel of the 5 best CNN based methods, improves the accuracy of the
   results and the F1-score. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
   building an assisting agent that will accompany the special needs
   children and adults, and assist them in their daily social interactions.},

Abstract = {Language model pre-training architectures have demonstrated to be useful
   to learn language representations. bidirectional encoder representations
   from transformers (BERT), a recent deep bidirectional self-attention
   representation from unlabelled text, has achieved remarkable results in
   many natural language processing (NLP) tasks with fine-tuning. In this
   paper, we want to demonstrate the efficiency of BERT for a
   morphologically rich language, Turkish. Traditionally morphologically
   difficult languages require dense language pre-processing steps in order
   to model the data to be suitable for machine learning (ML) algorithms.
   In particular, tokenization, lemmatization or stemming and feature
   engineering tasks are needed to obtain an efficient data model to
   overcome data sparsity or high-dimension problems. In this context, we
   selected five various Turkish NLP research problems as sentiment
   analysis, cyberbullying identification, text classification, emotion
   recognition and spam detection from the literature. We then compared the
   empirical performance of BERT with the baseline ML algorithms. Finally,
   we found enhanced results compared to base ML algorithms in the selected
   NLP problems while eliminating heavy pre-processing tasks.},

Abstract = {The range of works that can be considered as developing NLP for social
   good (NLP4SG) is enormous. While many of them target the identification
   of hate speech or fake news, there are others that address, e.g., text
   simplification to alleviate consequences of dyslexia, or coaching
   strategies to fight depression. However, so far, there is no clear
   picture of what areas are targeted by NLP4SG, who are the actors, which
   are the main scenarios and what are the topics that have been left
   aside. In order to obtain a clearer view in this respect, we first
   propose a working definition of NLP4SG and identify some primary aspects
   that are crucial for NLP4SG, including, e.g., tackled areas, ethics,
   privacy and bias. Then, we draw upon a corpus of around 50,000 articles
   downloaded from the ACL Anthology. Based on a list of keywords retrieved
   from the literature and revised in view of the task, we retrieve from
   this corpus articles that can be considered to be on NLP4SG according to
   our definition and analyze them. The result of the analysis is a map of
   the current NLP4SG research and insights concerning the white spots on
   this map.},

Title = {Developing a socio-computational approach to examine toxicity
   propagation and regulation in COVID-19 discourse on YouTube},

Abstract = {As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to ravage the world at an
   unprecedented rate, formal recommendations from medical experts are
   becoming muffled by the avalanche of toxic content posted on social
   media platforms. This high level of toxic content prevents the
   dissemination of important and time-sensitive information and
   jeopardizes the sense of community that online social networks (OSNs)
   seek to cultivate. In this article, we present techniques to analyze
   toxic content and actors that propagated it on YouTube during the
   initial months after COVID-19 information was made public. Our dataset
   consists of 544 channels, 3,488 videos, 453,111 commenters, and 849,689
   comments. We applied topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   (LDA) to identify dominant topics and evolving trends within the
   comments on relevant videos. We conducted social network analysis (SNA)
   to detect influential commenters, and toxicity analysis to measure the
   health of the network. SNA allows us to identify the top toxic users in
   the network, which led to the creation of experiments simulating the
   impact of removal of these users on toxicity in the network. Through
   this work, we demonstrate not only how to identify toxic content related
   to COVID-19 on YouTube and the actors who propagated this toxicity, but
   also how social media companies and policy makers can use this work.
   This work is novel in that we devised a set of experiments in an attempt
   to show how if social media platforms eliminate certain toxic users,
   they can improve the overall health of the network by reducing the
   overall toxicity level.},

Abstract = {Social media, a vast platform for communication and entertainment,
   unfortunately, is an ideal breeding ground for cyberbullying. While most
   common among teenagers, it also affects other demographics. Despite
   strict zero-tolerance policies on social media, the elusive nature of
   cyberbullying persists. Simple word searches are insufficient, leading
   to the exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect and
   classify cyberbullying. This study balances result accuracy with model
   simplicity, crucial for an effective detector. Quick identification of
   offensive content is essential to combat cyberbullying. The everchanging
   slang and trends require an easily updatable detector. Using a
   cyberbullying dataset from real tweets on X (formerly Twitter), this
   study initially applies traditional machine learning algorithms,
   including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees,
   and Random Forests. The investigation then moves to Transformers-based
   autoencoders from the BERT family, including sentence-transformers.
   However, these models require significant memory and disk space due to
   their large number of training parameters. The study focuses on the
   efficiency of cyberbullying detectors using character-level language
   models based on the bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural
   architecture. Our experiments demonstrate that these detectors offer
   comparable performance and provide a practical option for real-world
   deployment.},

Title = {Leveraging Transfer Learning for Hate Speech Detection in Portuguese
   Social Media Posts},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {101374-101389},
Abstract = {The rapid rise of social media has brought about new ways of digital
   communication, along with a worrying increase in online hate speech
   (HS), which, in turn, has led researchers to develop several Natural
   Language Processing methods for its detection. Although significant
   strides have been made in automating HS detection, research focusing on
   the European Portuguese language remains scarce (as it happens in
   several under-resourced languages). To address this gap, we explore the
   efficacy of various transfer learning models, which have been shown in
   the literature to have better performance for this task than other Deep
   Learning models. We employ BERT-like models pre-trained on Portuguese
   text, such as BERTimbau and mDeBERTa, as well as GPT, Gemini and Mistral
   generative models, for the detection of HS within Portuguese online
   discourse. Our study relies on two annotated corpora of YouTube comments
   and tweets, both annotated as HS and non-HS. Our findings show that the
   best model for the YouTube corpus was a variant of BERTimbau retrained
   with European Portuguese tweets and fine-tuned for the HS task, with an
   F-score of 87.1\% for the positive class, outperforming the baseline
   models by more than 20\% and with a 1.8\% increase compared with base
   BERTimbau. The best model for the Twitter corpus was GPT-3.5, with an
   F-score of 50.2\% for the positive class. We also assess the impact of
   using in-domain and mixed-domain training sets, as well as the impact of
   providing context in generative model prompts on their performance.},

Abstract = {today's digital age, the vast expanse of online content has made it
   increasingly accessible for users to encounter inappropriate text,
   images and videos. The repercussions of such exposure are concerning,
   impacting individuals and society adversely. Exposure to violent content
   can lead to undesirable human emotions, including desensitization,
   aggression, and other harmful effects. We utilize a machine learning
   approach aimed at real-time violence detection in text, images and
   videos embedded in the website. The foundation of this approach lies in
   a deep learning model, highly trained on a vast dataset of manually
   labeled images categorized as violent or non-violent. The model boasts
   exceptional accuracy in identifying violence in images, subsequently
   filter out violent content from online platforms. By performing all
   processing intensive tasks in the Cloud, and storing the data in a
   database, an improved user experience is achieved by completing all the
   necessary detection processes at a lower time frame, and also reducing
   the processing load on the user's local system. The detection of the
   violent videos is done by a CNN model, which was trained on violent and
   non-violent video data, and the detection of emotions in the text is
   taken in by a NLP based algorithm. By implementing this highly efficient
   approach, web safety can undergo a significant improvement. Users can
   now navigate the web with confidence, free from concerns about
   accidentally encountering violent content, fostering improved mental
   health, and cultivating a more positive online environment. We are able
   to achieve 67\% accuracy in detecting violent content at approximately
   2.5 seconds at its best scenario.},

Abstract = {Social media websites such as Twitter have become so indispensable today
   that people use them almost on a daily basis for sharing their emotions,
   opinions, suggestions and thoughts. Motivated by such behavioral
   tendencies, the purpose of this study is to define an approach to
   automatically classify the tweets on Twitter data into two main classes,
   namely, hate speech and non-hate speech. This provides a valuable source
   of information in analyzing and understanding target audiences and
   spotting marketing trends. We thus propose HiSAT, a Hierarchical
   framework for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. Sentiments/opinions in
   tweets are highly unstructured-and do not have a proper defined
   sequence. They constitute a heterogeneous data from many sources having
   different formats, and express either positive or negative, or neutral
   sentiment. Hence, in HiSAT we conduct Natural Language Processing
   encompassing tokenization, stemming and lemmatization techniques that
   convert text to tokens; as well as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques that convert
   text sentences into numeric vectors. These are then fed as inputs to
   Machine learning algorithms within the HiSAT framework; more
   specifically, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are
   used as text-binary classifiers to detect hate speech and non-hate
   speech from the tweets. Results of experiments performed with the HiSAT
   framework show that Random Forest outperforms the others with a better
   prediction in estimating the correct labels (with accuracy above the
   95\% range). We present the HiSAT approach, its implementation and
   experiments, along with related work and ongoing research.},

Abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform
   high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education,
   and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine
   learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are
   not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by
   documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this
   paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage
   such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents
   accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked
   evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different
   cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic
   location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type {[}15]) and intersectional groups
   (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant
   to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the
   context in which models are intended to be used, details of the
   performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While
   we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the
   application fields of computer vision and natural language processing,
   this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning
   model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised
   models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained
   to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step
   towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related
   artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how
   well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work
   encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany
   model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other
   relevant documentation.},

Title = {A review on abusive content automatic detection: approaches, challenges
   and opportunities},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The increasing use of social media has led to the emergence of a new
   challenge in the form of abusive content. There are many forms of
   abusive content such as hate speech, cyberbullying, offensive language,
   and abusive language. This article will present a review of abusive
   content automatic detection approaches. Specifically, we are focusing on
   the recent contributions that were using natural language processing
   (NLP) technologies to detect the abusive content in social media.
   Accordingly, we adopt PRISMA flow chart for selecting the related papers
   and filtering process with some of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Therefore, we select 25 papers for meta-analysis and another 87 papers
   were cited in this article during the span of 2017-2021. In addition, we
   searched for the available datasets that are related to abusive content
   categories in three repositories and we highlighted some points related
   to the obtained results. Moreover, after a comprehensive review this
   article propose a new taxonomy of abusive content automatic detection by
   covering five different aspects and tasks. The proposed taxonomy gives
   insights and a holistic view of the automatic detection process.
   Finally, this article discusses and highlights the challenges and
   opportunities for the abusive content automatic detection problem.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is a malady of social media, and its automatic detection
   is critically important considering its virulence, velocity of
   spreading, and the scale of the havoc it can wreak. However, the problem
   is challenging due to its disguised behavior, noise in the content, and,
   in recent times, introduction of code-mixing. In this work, we propose
   MTBullyGNN a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based multitask (MT)
   framework that solves sentiment-aided cyberbullying detection (CD) from
   code-mixed language. The GNN helps detect unlabelled or noisy label
   nodes (sentences) accurately by aggregating information from similarly
   labeled nodes. To connect nodes, we apply cosine similarity between
   sentences and create a single text graph for a benchmark code-mixed
   cyberbullying corpus, BullySent. Experimental results illustrate that
   MTBullyGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for both the
   single (CD) and MT (CD and sentiment) settings by up to 4.46\% and
   4.92\% in classification accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, another
   benchmark Hindi-English code-mixed single-task dataset has also been
   considered to illustrate the robustness of our proposed model. The code
   will be made publicly available in the camera-ready version.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to detect and classify websites based on
   their content if it encourages spreading hate speech toward Islam and
   Muslims, or Islamophobia using sentiment analysis and web text mining
   techniques. In this research, a large dataset corpus has been collected,
   to identify and classify anti-Islamic online contents. Our target is to
   automatically detect the content of those websites that are hostile to
   Islam and transmitting extremist ideas against it. The main purpose is
   to reduce the spread of those webpages that give the wrong idea about
   Islam. The proper dataset is collected from different sources, and the
   two datasets for the Arabic language (balanced and unbalanced) have been
   produced. The framework of the proposed approach has been described. The
   approach used in this framework is based on supervised Machine Learning
   (ML) approach using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Naive
   Bayes (MNB) models as classifiers, and Term Frequency-Inverse Document
   Frequency (TF-IDF) as feature extraction. Different experiments
   including word level and trigram level on the two datasets have been
   conducted, and compared the obtained results. The experimental results
   shows that the supervised ML approach using word level is the finest
   approach for both datasets that produce high accuracy with 97\% applied
   on the balanced Arabic dataset using SVM algorithm with TF-IDF as
   feature extraction. Finally, an interactive webapplication prototype has
   been developed and built in order to detect and classify toxic language
   such as anti-Islamic online textcontents.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new paradigm of building
   natural language processing (NLP) systems: general-purpose, pre-trained
   language models (LMs) are composed with simple downstream models and
   fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks. This paradigm shift significantly
   simplifies the system development cycles. However, as many LMs are
   provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization or
   regulation entails profound security implications, which are largely
   unexplored.
   To bridge this gap, this work studies the security threats posed by
   malicious LMs to NLP systems. Specifically, we present TROJAN(LM), a new
   class of trojaning attacks in which maliciously crafted LMs trigger host
   NLP systems to malfunction in a highly predictable manner. By
   empirically studying three state-of-the-art LMs (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) in
   a range of security-critical NLP tasks (toxic comment detection,
   question answering, text completion) as well as user studies on
   crowdsourcing platforms, we demonstrate that TROJAN(LM) possesses the
   following properties: (i) flexibility - the adversary is able to
   flexibly define logical combinations (e.g., `and', `or', `xor') of
   arbitrary words as triggers, (ii) efficacy - the host systems misbehave
   as desired by the adversary with high probability when
   ``trigger{''}-embedded inputs are present, (iii) specificity - the
   trojan LMs function indistinguishably from their benign counterparts on
   clean inputs, and (iv) fluency - the trigger-embedded inputs appear as
   fluent natural language and highly relevant to their surrounding
   contexts. We provide analytical justification for the practicality of
   TROJAN(LM), and further discuss potential countermeasures and their
   challenges, which lead to several promising research directions.},

Abstract = {The spread of toxic content online is an important problem that has
   adverse effects on user experience online and in our society at large.
   Motivated by the importance and impact of the problem, research focuses
   on developing solutions to detect toxic content, usually leveraging
   machine learning (ML) models trained on human-annotated datasets. While
   these efforts are important, these models usually do not generalize well
   and they can not cope with new trends (e.g., the emergence of new toxic
   terms). Currently, we are witnessing a shift in the approach to tackling
   societal issues online, particularly leveraging large language models
   (LLMs) like GPT-3 or T5 that are trained on vast corpora and have strong
   generalizability. In this work, we investigate how we can use LLMs and
   prompt learning to tackle the problem of toxic content, particularly
   focusing on three tasks; 1) Toxicity Classification, 2) Toxic Span
   Detection, and 3) Detoxification. We perform an extensive evaluation
   over five model architectures and eight datasets demonstrating that LLMs
   with prompt learning can achieve similar or even better performance
   compared to models trained on these specific tasks. We find that prompt
   learning achieves around 10\% improvement in the toxicity classification
   task compared to the baselines, while for the toxic span detection task
   we find better performance to the best baseline (0.643 vs. 0.640 in
   terms of F-1-score). Finally, for the detoxification task, we find that
   prompt learning can successfully reduce the average toxicity score (from
   0.775 to 0.213) while preserving semantic meaning.(1)},

Abstract = {The recent interest in identifying and mitigating bias in computational
   systems has introduced a wide range of different-and occasionally
   incomparable-proposals for what constitutes bias in such systems. This
   tutorial introduces the language of measurement modeling from the
   quantitative social sciences as a framework for examining how social,
   organizational, and political values enter computational systems and
   unpacking the varied normative concerns operationalized in different
   techniques for measuring ``bias.{''} We showthat this framework helps to
   clarify the way unobservable theoretical constructs-such as
   ``creditworthiness,{''} ``risk to society,{''} or ``tweet
   toxicity{''}-are turned into measurable quantities and how this process
   may introduce fairness-related harms. In particular, we demonstrate
   howto systematically assess the construct validity and reliability of
   these measurements to detect and characterize specific types of harms,
   which arise from mismatches between constructs and their
   operationalizations. We then take a critical look at existing approaches
   to examining ``bias{''} in NLP models, ranging from work on embedding
   spaces to machine translation and hate speech detection. We show that
   measurement modeling can help uncover the implicit constructs that
   suchwork aims to capture when measuring ``bias.{''} In so doing, we
   illustrate the limits of current ``debiasing{''} techniques, which have
   obscured the specific harms whose measurements they implicitly aim to
   reduce. By introducing the language of measurement modeling, we provide
   the FAT{*} community with a framework for making explicit and testing
   assumptions about unobservable theoretical constructs embedded in
   computational systems, thereby clarifying and uniting our understandings
   of fairness-related harms.},

Abstract = {The emergence of digital and their products, such as Facebook, Twitter,
   Reddit, Instagram, and other social media entities, has become the
   dominant medium for exchanging information, connecting people,
   expressing emotion and feelings, and influencing audiences and
   communities. Sometimes, these platforms are used by some social media
   users to engage in inappropriate behavior and expression by using
   offensive, hateful, and harassing content to express their views and
   dissatisfaction. Negative, hateful, and abusive content can hurt or harm
   other social media users and communities and can lead to law and order
   problems in society. There is a need to stop and mitigate the effects of
   hate speech by developing intelligent systems and models to detect them.
   Artificial Intelligence/machine learning can help in the detection of
   social media posts, comments, and replies that are hateful, abusive, and
   offensive. Such content also correlated with race, gender, sexuality,
   religion, and age. The objective is to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed model in comparison to other machine learning and deep learning
   algorithms on the newly collected data. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed model, CNN with word embeddings, exhibits
   outstanding performance in hate speech detection. It achieves a
   remarkable accuracy of 83\%. CNN's word embeddings' contextual
   understanding of language and its ability to capture complex semantic
   relationships contribute significantly to its superior performance
   compared to other traditional machine learning and deep learning models.},

Title = {Textual Feature Extraction Using Ant Colony Optimization for Hate Speech
   Classification},

Abstract = {Feature selection and feature extraction have always been of utmost
   importance owing to their capability to remove redundant and irrelevant
   features, reduce the vector space size, control the computational time,
   and improve performance for more accurate classification tasks,
   especially in text categorization. These feature engineering techniques
   can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper
   proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization
   algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different
   feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and
   numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic
   Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent
   (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the
   results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis.
   The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist
   in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This
   research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke
   prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is
   prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and
   neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy
   of 10.07\% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature
   extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also
   highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of
   machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43\% in
   accuracy compared to that of numerical data.},

Title = {Target-Oriented Investigation of Online Abusive Attacks: A Dataset and
   Analysis},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {64114-64127},
Abstract = {Despite a body of research revolving around online abusive language,
   aiming at different objectives such as detection, diffusion prediction,
   and mitigation, existing research has seldom looked at factors
   motivating this behaviour. To further research in this direction, we
   investigate the motivations behind online abuse by looking at the
   characteristics of the targets of such abuse, i.e. is the abuse more
   prominent for specific characteristics of the targets? To enable
   target-oriented research into online abuse, we introduce the Online
   Abusive Attacks (OAA) dataset, the first benchmark dataset providing a
   holistic view of online abusive attacks, including social media profile
   data and metadata for both targets and perpetrators, in addition to
   context. The dataset contains 2.3K Twitter accounts, 5M tweets, and
   106.9K categorised conversations. Further, we conduct an in-depth
   statistical analysis of online abuse centred around the targets'
   characteristics. We identify two types of abusive attacks: those
   motivated by characteristics of the targets (identity-based attacks) and
   others (behavioural attacks). We find that online abusive attacks are
   predominantly motivated by the targets' identities (97\%), behavioural
   attacks accounting for a much smaller proportion (3\%). Abuse is also
   more likely to target users who are popular and have a verified status.
   Interestingly, an analysis of the user bios shows no clear indication
   that keywords used in the bios are likely to trigger abuse.
   Additionally, we also look at the frequency with which perpetrators
   perform online abusive attacks. Our analysis shows a large number of
   infrequent perpetrators, with only a few recurrent perpetrators.
   Findings from our study have important implications for the development
   of abusive language detection models that incorporate an awareness of
   the targets to improve their potential for prediction.},

Title = {Domain-Specific Keyword Extraction Using Joint Modeling of Local and
   Global Contextual Semantics},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Domain-specific keyword extraction is a vital task in the field of text
   mining. There are various research tasks, such as spam e-mail
   classification, abusive language detection, sentiment analysis, and
   emotion mining, where a set of domain-specific keywords (aka lexicon) is
   highly effective. Existing works for keyword extraction list all
   keywords rather than domain-specific keywords from a document corpus.
   Moreover, most of the existing approaches perform well on formal
   document corpuses but fail on noisy and informal user-generated content
   in online social media. In this article, we present a hybrid approach by
   jointly modeling the local and global contextual semantics of words,
   utilizing the strength of distributional word representation and
   contrasting-domain corpus for domain-specific keyword extraction.
   Starting with a seed set of a few domain-specific keywords, we model the
   text corpus as a weighted word-graph. In this graph, the initial weight
   of a node (word) represents its semantic association with the target
   domain calculated as a linear combination of three semantic association
   metrics, and the weight of an edge connecting a pair of nodes represents
   the co-occurrence count of the respective words. Thereafter, a modified
   PageRank method is applied to the word-graph to identify the most
   relevant words for expanding the initial set of domain-specific
   keywords. We evaluate our method over both formal and informal text
   corpuses (comprising six datasets), and show that it performs
   significantly better in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.
   Furthermore, we generalize our approach to handle the language-agnostic
   case, and show that it outperforms existing language-agnostic
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Cartoons are an informative way for creating awareness; children take
   keen interest in watching cartoons and spend leisure time in front of
   television. Unfortunately there is an inclination towards violence and
   other objectionable scenes in cartoon videos that have very bad impact
   on the developing personality of children. Extensive use of such violent
   scenes is one of the factors of increase of violence in society. Parents
   rely on cartoons as a mean of amusement for their children without
   analyzing its content which can pose serious negative impacts on child
   behavior. To protect children from violent content means are require for
   automatic detection of violence content in cartoon videos. In this paper
   different low-level visual features are evaluated for violence detection
   in cartoon videos using indigenously developed dataset that is
   categorized as violent and non-violent. From our results it has been
   observed that low-level visual features could not be used efficiently
   for the detection of violence. However these features are very helpful
   in identifying the character and situation that if combined with a
   knowledgebase capability can be used for detection of violence and other
   objectionable elements in the cartoon videos.},

Abstract = {Our previous study on classification and detection of abusive language
   in South African social media space has shown the high prospect of
   surface level features and classical machine learning models in terms of
   accuracy. However, much improvement is still needed in the aspect of
   F1-score. Therefore, the state-of-the-arts such as neural embeddings
   (Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GloVe) and neural network-based transformer models
   (BERT and mBERT) which have performed well inmany hate speech isolation
   tasks are explored in thiswork. In the evaluation of classical machine
   learning algorithms, Word2Vec with SupportVector Machine outperformed
   the previous models, Doc2Vec andGloVe in terms of F1-score. In the
   evaluation of neural networks, all the neural embedding and transformer
   models performed worse than the previous models in terms of F1-score. In
   conclusion, the impressive performance of Word2Vec neural embedding with
   classical machine learning algorithms in terms of best F1-score of 0.62
   and accuracy of 0.86 shows its good prospect in the isolation of abusive
   language and hate speech in South African social media space.},

Abstract = {Social media have become a very viable medium for communication,
   collaboration, exchange of information, knowledge, and ideas. However,
   due to anonymity preservation, the incidents of hate speech and
   cyberbullying have been diversified across the globe. This intimidating
   problem has recently sought the attention of researchers and scholars
   worldwide and studies have been undertaken to formulate solution
   strategies for automatic detection of cyberaggression and hate speech,
   varying from machine learning models with vast features to more complex
   deep neural network models and different SN platforms. However, the
   existing research is directed towards mature languages and highlights a
   huge gap in newly embraced resource poor languages. One such language
   that has been recently adopted worldwide and more specifically by south
   Asian countries for communication on social media is Roman Urdu i-e Urdu
   language written using Roman scripting. To address this research gap, we
   have performed extensive preprocessing on Roman Urdu microtext. This
   typically involves formation of Roman Urdu slang- phrase dictionary and
   mapping slangs after tokenization. We have also eliminated cyberbullying
   domain specific stop words for dimensionality reduction of corpus. The
   unstructured data were further processed to handle encoded text formats
   and metadata/non-linguistic features. Furthermore, we performed
   extensive experiments by implementing RNN-LSTM, RNN-BiLSTM and CNN
   models varying epochs executions, model layers and tuning
   hyperparameters to analyze and uncover cyberbullying textual patterns in
   Roman Urdu. The efficiency and performance of models were evaluated
   using different metrics to present the comparative analysis. Results
   highlight that RNN-LSTM and RNN-BiLSTM performed best and achieved
   validation accuracy of 85.5 and 85\% whereas F1 score was 0.7 and 0.67
   respectively over aggression class.},

Abstract = {The evolution of social media and online platforms created more
   opportunities to express one's thoughts without any burden. This
   emergence paved the way to construct more intelligent systems but by
   taking advantage of these platforms some people display their vengeance
   by harassing or abusing comments. The attackers leak sensitive
   information about an individual or an organization through the internet
   using abusive words, hate comments, threatening information, fake news,
   etc. So, online shaming detection with an optimum classification
   mechanism becomes necessary to avoid such negative consequences. In this
   paper, a novel online shaming detection mechanism using a Convolutional
   Neural Network Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-based Hybrid
   Archimedes Tasmanian Devil (CNNBiGRU-HATD) approach is proposed to
   detect and classify the offensive comments and non-offensive comments.
   If the comment seems offensive, it is further classified into six
   categories according to shaming types such as abusive, doxing, Passing
   Judgment, Ethnic/Religious, Joke/Sarcasm, and Whataboutery. The utilized
   four Twitter-based datasets are initially preprocessed and feature
   extracted to improve the classification performance of the CNNBiGRU-HATD
   approach. After accurate classification, the information from the
   classified shaming types is collected and authenticated. The proposed
   approach is simulated using the Python platform. To validate the
   potential capability of the proposed CNNBiGRU-HATD approach, it is
   related to the existing methods by various parameters. The experimental
   result reveals that the proposed CNNBiGRU-HATD method achieves higher
   accuracy of 96.5\% for the labeled hate speech detection dataset.},

Abstract = {In recent years, social media has become an everyday tool for the
   distribution of videos in which signs of violence appear in different
   ways. Citizens of smart cities are demanding increasing efforts to
   authorities in order to maintain public safety, as well as to be
   efficient in an emergency response. The complexity of monitoring
   automatically the enormous amount of information generated through
   social networks results in the need for the development of systems that
   allow for the automatic detection of violent content in videos. This
   fact is becoming increasingly important in order to guarantee security
   for the citizens in any smart city. As a result, this work proposes the
   development of a system for detecting violence in videos by combining
   different descriptors that calculate the acceleration produced between
   two frames of a video. To do this, different techniques, such as the
   Radon transform or optical flow, are used. The trained system then
   performs the classification using support vector Machines. The results
   are promising, with accuracy rates between 85 and 97\%, depending on the
   complexity of the databases used, which demonstrates the validity of our
   proposal.},

Abstract = {Detecting violence in images has emerged as an important area of
   research and application as digital imaging and computer vision advance.
   Detecting and assessing violent content automatically in visual data
   holds great promise for enhancing public safety, security, and content
   moderation. Violent incidents are difficult to detect because of
   disruptions in optical flow, complications caused by camera aperture
   variations, and difficulties with illumination and feature tracking. In
   this work, a novel (FDNN)-D-3-Net has been proposed for violence
   detection in images. The input videos from the surveillance camera are
   initially converted into frame sequences and pre-processed. The Yolov8
   (You Only Look Once) algorithm is employed to detect objects within
   pre-processed frames. Simultaneously, the ego algorithm is applied to
   the pre-processed images for motion estimation, ensuring comprehensive
   coverage of information. Afterwards, the features are extracted using
   the fined feature extraction phase as independent component analysis
   (ICA), and the selected features are selected using the Dingo algorithm.
   Then, the fine-tuned fused (FF) features are implemented in the deep
   neural network (DNN) approach for the categorization of violent and
   non-violent cases. According to the findings, the proposed
   (FDNN)-D-3-Net detects violence in images with an accuracy rate of
   99.33\%. The proposed DNN enhances an overall F1-score of 10.46\%,
   6.91\%, and 4.44\%, better than Alex Net, ResNet, and Dense Net. The
   proposed (FDNN)-D-3-Net enhances the overall accuracy by 6\%, 0.3\%, and
   29.33\% better than Inception-Resnet-V2, CNN, LSTM, and ResNet50,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Violent threat is a serious crime affecting the targeted individuals or
   groups. It is essential for media providers to block the users that post
   such threats. In this paper, we focused on detection of violent threat
   language in YouTube comments. We categorized the threatening comments
   into those targeting an individual or a group. We started from an
   existing dataset with violent threat language identified, but without
   any categorization into comments targeting individuals or groups. We
   adopted a binary classification approach for the prediction of
   individual- vs. group-targeting threats. We compared two text
   representations: bag of words (BOW) and pre-trained word embedding such
   as GloVe and fastText. We used deep-learning classifiers such as 1D-CNN,
   LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). GloVe embedding showed the worst
   results, fastText performed much better, and BiLSTM on BOW with term
   frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme gave the
   best results, achieving 0.94\% ROC-AUC and Macro-F1 score of 0.85\%.},

Title = {Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for Sentiment Analysis in
   Slovak},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The process of determining and understanding the emotional tone
   expressed in a text, with a focus on textual data, is referred to as
   sentiment analysis. This analysis facilitates the identification of
   whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
   Sentiment analysis on social networks seeks valuable insight into public
   opinions, trends, and user sentiments. The main motivation is to enable
   informed decisions and an understanding of the dynamics of online
   discourse by businesses and researchers. Additionally, sentiment
   analysis plays a vital role in the field of hate speech detection,
   aiding in the identification and mitigation of harmful content on social
   networks. In this paper, studies on the sentiment analysis of texts in
   the Slovak language, as well as in other languages, are introduced. The
   primary aim of the paper, aside from releasing the ``SentiSK{''} dataset
   to the public, is to evaluate our dataset by comparing its results with
   those of other existing datasets in the Slovak language. The
   ``SentiSK{''} dataset, consisting of 34,006 comments, was created,
   specified, and annotated for the task of sentiment analysis. The
   proposed approach involved the utilization of three datasets in the
   Slovak language, with nine classification methods trained and compared
   in two defined tasks. For the first task, testing on the ``SentiSK{''}
   and ``Sentigrade{''} datasets involved three classes (positive, neutral,
   and negative). In the second task, testing on the ``SentiSK{''},
   ``Sentigrade{''}, and ``Slovak dataset for SA{''} datasets involved two
   classes (positive and negative). Selected models achieved an F1 score
   ranging from 75.35\% to 95.04\%.},

Abstract = {Modern neural networks are quite demanding regarding the size and
   coverage of adequate training evidences, as far as complex inferences
   are involved. This is the case of offensive language detection that
   focuses on a phenomenon, the recognition of offensive uses of language,
   that is elusive and multifaceted. In this scenarios gathering training
   data can be prohibitively expensive and the dynamics and
   multidimensional nature of the abusive language phenomena are also
   demanding of timely and evolving evidence for training in a continuous
   fashion.
   The MT-GAN-BERT approach proposed here aims to reduce the requirements
   of neural approaches both in terms of the amount of annotated data and
   the computational cost required at classification time. It focuses
   corresponds to a general BERT-based architecture for multi faceted text
   classification tasks. On the one side, MT-GAN-BERT enables
   semisupervised learning for Transformers based on the Generative
   Adversarial Learning paradigm. It also implements a Multi-task Learning
   approach able to train over and solve multiple tasks, simultaneously. A
   single BERT-based model is used to encode the input examples, while
   multiple linear layers are used to implement the classification steps,
   with a significant reduction of the computational costs. In the
   experimental evaluations we studied six classification tasks related to
   the detection of abusive uses of language in Italian. Outcomes suggest
   that MT-GAN-BERT is sustainable and generally improves the raw adoption
   of multiple BERTbased models, with much lighter requirements in terms of
   annotated data and computational costs.},

Abstract = {Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning has attracted intensive research
   interests in recent years, which is capable of training a binary
   classifier solely based on positive and unlabeled examples when the
   negative data are absent or too are diverse. However, the existing PU
   learning methods largely overlook the relationship between the examples
   when handling the unlabeled data, leading to insufficient exploitation
   of data structure which actually contains useful distribution
   information. Therefore, by following the multi-manifold assumption which
   is observed in many real-world vision problems, this paper proposes a
   novel algorithm termed ``Multi-Manifold PU learning{''} (MMPU), which
   assumes that the data belonging to different classes lie on different
   underlying manifolds. As such, the structural information revealed by
   the dataset is deployed, which is helpful in deciding the labels of
   unlabeled examples. Our MMPU contains two main steps, namely,
   multi-manifold exploration and positive confidence training, where the
   former is accomplished by computing the local similarity, structural
   similarity, and semantic similarity of pairwise data, and the latter
   establishes a binary classifier in reproducing kernel Hilbert space
   based on the real-valued confidence level of each example to be
   positive. Experimentally, we not only test the proposed MMPU on five
   highly nonlinear synthetic datasets but also apply MMPU to various
   typical computer vision tasks, including handwritten digit recognition,
   violent behavior detection, and hyperspectral image classification. The
   results demonstrate that MMPU can obtain a superior performance compared
   to the state-of-the-art PU learning methodologies.},

Abstract = {Hate Speech on Social Media is definitely an evolving threat for every
   nation, especially for countries like Myanmar. Lack of media and digital
   literacy is playing a huge role in making people insult to each other or
   misallocating their stresses to others without physical encounter.
   Moreover, disingenuous politicians fuel online hate speech campaigns
   backstage of the elections by targeting different religions in the
   regard of heretics and using racialism. To emphasize this matter, we
   scraped over 16,000 social media comments from the most popular social
   media platform in Myanmar and performed hate-speech research using those
   samples. With the precise definition of a hate speech labelling
   guideline, annotation on the sample dataset was done systematically and
   efficiently. Experiments and evaluations were conducted using different
   linear and non-linear deep-learning classification models. Performances
   of the models are at the peak in Logistic Regression among linear models
   with 0.8974 AUC score and XLM-RoBERTa among deep learning models with
   0.8958 AUC score on the test dataset. We observed that it is more
   advantageous to use linear models on our dataset since they achieved
   comparable results to the deep learning models and have much lower
   computational cost.},

Title = {Context-aware sentiment analysis with attention-enhanced features from
   bidirectional transformers},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a means of excerpting subjective information from
   client reviews. The existing shallow model lacks in addressing multiple
   relation/meaning of a word in a review. To address the above issue and
   to find an effective contextual word embedding, we have performed a
   thorough analysis on the existing language model, viz., Universal
   Language Model Fine-tuning, Embeddings from Language Models and
   Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Based on
   the analysis, we have proposed a transfer learning-based bidirectional
   transformer model. We have conducted several experiments with the
   different transfer learning-based bidirectional transformer models to
   find a robust classifier for contextual embedding. In these various
   transfer learning approaches, the attention-extracted features are fed
   into different classifiers, viz., support vector machine (SVM), logistic
   regression (LR), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional gated
   recurrent unit (BGRU). BERT is a multi-head, multilayered and
   bidirectional transformer that finds deep contextual words existing in a
   review by exhibiting different patterns in different layers. In the
   proposed architecture, the attention-extracted deep contextual features
   from BERT are fed into the BGRU through transfer learning to have better
   contextual classification. With the proposed attention-extracted
   BERT-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (i.e., AeBERT-BGRU), we have
   obtained an F-1 score of 95.57, 86.66 and 80.29\% for IMDB, Polarity and
   OLID dataset (weighted), which is a significant improvement when
   compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Title = {A probabilistic clustering model for hate speech classification in
   twitter},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The key challenges for automatic hate-speech classification in Twitter
   are the lack of generic architecture, imprecision, threshold settings
   and fragmentation issues. Most studies used binary classifiers for hate
   speech classification, but these classifiers cannot really capture other
   emotions that may overlap between positive or negative class. Hence, a
   probabilistic clustering model for hate speech classification in twitter
   was developed to tackle problems with hate speech classification. A
   metadata extractor was used to collect tweets containing hate speech
   keywords and a crowd-sourced experts was employed to label the collected
   hate tweets into two categories: hate speech and non-hate speech.
   Features representation was done with Term Frequency-Inverse Document
   Frequency (TF-IDF) model and enhanced with topics inferred by a Bayes
   classifier. A rule-based clustering method was used to automatically
   classify real-time tweets into the correct topic clusters. Fuzzy logic
   was then used for hate speech classification using semantic fuzzy rules
   and a score computation module. From the evaluation results, it was
   observed that the developed model performed better in hate speech
   detection with F1-sore of 0.9256 using a 5-fold cross validation.
   Similarly, the developed model for hate speech classification performed
   better with F1-score of 91.5 compared to related models. The developed
   model also indicates a more perfect test having an AUC of 0.9645, when
   compared to similar methods. The Paired Sample t-Test validated the
   efficiency of the developed model for hate speech classification.},

Abstract = {Question and answer websites such as Quora, Stack Overflow, Yahoo
   Answers and Answer Bag are used by professionals. Multiple users post
   questions on these websites to get the answers from domain specific
   professionals. These websites are multilingual meaning they are
   available in many different languages. Current problem for these types
   of websites is to handle meaningless and irrelevant content. In this
   paper we have worked on the Quora insincere questions (questions which
   are based on false assumptions or questions which are trying to make a
   statement rather than seeking for helpful answers) dataset in order to
   identify user insincere questions, so that Quora can eliminate those
   questions from their platform and ultimately improve the communication
   among users over the platform. Previously, a research was carried out
   with recurrent neural network and pretrained glove word embeddings, that
   achieved the F1 score of 0.69. The proposed study has used a pre-trained
   ULMFiT model. This model has outperformed the previous model with an F1
   score of 0.91, which is much higher than the previous studies.},

Abstract = {In recent times, the detection of hate-speech, offensive, or abusive
   language in online media has become an important topic in NLP research
   due to the exponential growth of social media and the propagation of
   such messages, as well as their impact. Misogyny detection, even though
   it plays an important part in hatespeech detection, has not received the
   same attention. In this paper, we describe our classification systems
   submitted to the SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic
   Misogyny Identification. The shared task aimed to identify misogynous
   content in a multi-modal setting by analysing meme images together with
   their textual captions. To this end, we propose two models based on the
   pre-trained UNITER model, one enhanced with an image sentiment
   classifier, whereas the second leverages a Vocabulary Graph
   Convolutional Network (VGCN). Additionally, we explore an ensemble using
   the aforementioned models. Our best model reaches an F1-score of 71.4\%
   in Sub-task A and 67.3\% for Sub-task B positioning our team in the
   upper third of the leaderboard. We release the code and experiments for
   our models on GitHub(1).},

Title = {Large scale annotated dataset for code-mix abusive short noisy text},
Journal = {LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 25},
Abstract = {With globalization and cultural exchange around the globe, most of the
   population gained knowledge of at least two languages. The bilingual
   user base on the Social Media Platform (SMP) has significantly
   contributed to the popularity of code-mixing. However, apart from
   multiple vital uses, SMP also suffer with abusive text content.
   Identifying abusive instances for a single language is a challenging
   task, and even more challenging for code-mix. The abusive posts
   detection problem is more complicated than it seems due to its unseemly,
   noisy data and uncertain context. To analyze these contents, the
   research community needs an appropriate dataset. A small dataset is not
   a suitable sample for the research work. In this paper, we have analyzed
   the dimensions of Devanagari-Roman code-mix in short noisy text. We have
   also discussed the challenges of abusive instances. We have proposed a
   cost-effective methodology with 20.38\% relevancy score to collect and
   annotate the code-mix abusive text instances. Our dataset is eight times
   to the related state-of-the-art dataset. Our dataset ensures the balance
   with 55.81\% instances in the abusive class and 44.19\% in the
   non-abusive class. We have also conducted experiments to verify the
   usefulness of the dataset. We have performed experiments with
   traditional machine learning techniques, traditional neural network
   architecture, recurrent neural network architectures, and pre-trained
   Large Language Model (LLM). From our experiments, we have observed the
   suitability of the dataset for further scientific work.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen substantial investments in AI-based tools
   designed to detect offensive language at scale, aiming to moderate
   social media platforms, and ensure safety of conversational AI
   technologies such as ChatGPT and Bard. These efforts largely treat this
   task as a technical endeavor, relying on data annotated for
   offensiveness by a global crowd workforce, without considering crowd
   workers' socio-cultural backgrounds or the values their perceptions
   reflect. Existing research that examines systematic variations in
   annotators' judgments often reduces these differences to
   socio-demographic categories along racial, or gender dimensions,
   overlooking the diversity of perspectives within such groups. On the
   other hand, social psychology literature highlights the crucial role
   that both cultural and psychological factors play in human perceptions
   and judgments. Through a large-scale cross-cultural study of 4309
   participants from 21 countries across eight cultural regions, we
   demonstrate substantial cross-cultural and individual moral value-based
   differences in interpretations of offensiveness. Our study reveals
   specific regions that are significantly more sensitive to offensive
   language. Furthermore, using the Moral Foundations Theory, we study the
   underlying moral values that contribute to these cross-cultural
   differences. Notably, we find that participants' moral values play a far
   more important role in shaping their perceptions of offensiveness than
   geo-cultural distinctions. Our investigation, using a non-monolithic
   framework to understand cross-cultural moral concerns, reveals crucial
   insights that can be extrapolated to building AI models for the
   pluralistic world. Our results call for more extensive consideration of
   diverse human moral values when deploying AI models across diverse
   geo-cultural contexts.},

Title = {Improving the accuracy of text classification using stemming method, a
   case of non-formal Indonesian conversation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},

Abstract = {Background: Stemming has long been used in data pre-processing to
   retrieve information by tracking affixed words back into their root. In
   an Indonesian setting, existing stemming methods have been observed, and
   the existing stemming methods are proven to result in high accuracy
   level. However, there are not many stemming methods for non-formal
   Indonesian text processing. This study introduces a new stemming method
   to solve problems in the non-formal Indonesian text data pre-processing.
   Furthermore, this study aims to improve the accuracy of text classifier
   models by strengthening stemming method. Using the Support Vector
   Machine algorithm, a text classifier model is developed, and its
   accuracy is checked. The experimental evaluation was done by testing 550
   datasets in Indonesian using two different stemming methods.
   Findings: The results show that using the proposed stemming method, the
   text classifier model has higher accuracy than the existing methods with
   a score of 0.85 and 0.73, respectively. These results indicate that the
   proposed stemming methods produces a classifier model with a small error
   rate, so it will be more accurate to predict a class of objects.
   Conclusion: The existing Indonesian stemming methods are still oriented
   towards Indonesian formal sentences, therefore the method has
   limitations to be used in Indonesian non-formal sentences. This
   phenomenon underlies the suggestion of developing a corpus by
   normalizing Indonesian non-formal into formal to be used as a better
   stemming method. The impact of using the corpus as a stemming method is
   that it can improve the accuracy of the classifier model. In the future,
   the proposed corpus and stemming methods can be used for various
   purposes including text clustering, summarizing, detecting hate speech,
   and other text processing applications in Indonesian.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {194027-194044},
Abstract = {Social Media has become an integral part of our daily life. Not only it
   enables collaboration and flow of information but has also become an
   imperative tool for businesses and governments around the world. All
   this makes a compelling case for everyone to be on some sort of online
   social media platform. However, this virtuousness is overshadowed by
   some of its shortcomings. The manifestation of antisocial behaviour
   online is a growing concern that hinders participation and cultivates
   numerous social problems. Antisocial behaviour exists in its various
   forms such as aggression, disregard for safety, lack of remorse,
   unlawful behaviour, etc. The paper introduces a deep learning-based
   approach to detect and classify online antisocial behaviour (ASB). The
   automatic content classification addresses the issue of scalability,
   which is imperative when dealing with online platforms. A benchmark
   dataset was created with multi-class annotation under the supervision of
   a domain expert. Extensive experiments were conducted with multiple deep
   learning algorithms and their superior results were validated against
   the results from the traditional machine learning algorithms. Visually
   enhanced interpretation of the classification process is presented for
   model and error analyses. Accuracy of up to 99\% in class identification
   was achieved on the ground truth dataset for empirical validation. The
   study is an evidence of how the cutting-edge deep learning technology
   can be utilized to solve a real-world problem of curtailing antisocial
   behaviour, which is a public health threat and a social problem.},

Abstract = {Due to Coronavirus diseases in 2020, all the countries departed into
   lockdown to combat the spread of the pandemic situation. Schools and
   institutions remain closed and students' screen time surged. The classes
   for the students are moved to the digital platform which leads to an
   increase in social media usage. Many children had become sufferers of
   cyber harassment which includes threatening comments on young students,
   sexual torture through a digital platform, people insulting one another,
   and the use of fake accounts to harass others. The rising effort on
   automated cyber harassment detection utilizes many AI-related components
   Natural language processing techniques and machine learning approaches.
   Though machine learning models using different algorithms fail to
   converge with higher accuracy, it is much more important to use
   significant natural language processes and efficient classifiers to
   detect cyberbullying comments on social media. In this proposed work,
   the lexical meaning of the text is analysed by the conventional scheme
   and the word order of the text is performed by the Fast Text model to
   improve the computational efficacy of the model. The intention of the
   text is analysed by various feature extraction methods. The score for
   intention detection is calculated using the frequency of words with a
   bully-victim participation score. Finally, the proposed model's
   performance is measured by different evaluation metrics which illustrate
   that the accuracy of the model is higher than many other existing
   classification methods. The error rate is lesser for the detection
   model.},

Abstract = {Violence detection based on deep learning is a research hotspot in
   intelligent video surveillance. The pre-trained Three-Dimensional
   convolutional network (C3D) has a weak ability to extract spatiotemporal
   features of video. It can only achieve an accuracy of 88.2\% on the
   UCF-101 data set, which cannot meet the accuracy requirements for
   detecting violent behavior in videos. Thus, this paper proposes a
   network architecture based on the C3D and fusion of the
   InceptionResnet-v2 network residual Inception module. Through adaptive
   learning of feature weights, the three-dimensional features of violent
   behavior videos can be fully explored and the ability to express
   features is enhanced. Secondly, in view of the small amount of data in
   the data set for violence detection (HockeyFights), which easily leads
   to the problems of overfitting and low generalization ability, the
   UCF101 data set is used for fine-tune, so that the shallow layer of the
   network can fully extract the spatiotemporal features; Finally, the use
   of quantization tools to quantify network parameters and adjusting the
   sliding window parameters during inference can effectively improves the
   inference efficiency and improves the real-time performance while
   ensuring high accuracy. Through experiments, the accuracy of the network
   designed in the paper on the UCF-101 dataset is improved by 6.1\%
   compared to the C3D network, and by 3.1\% compared with the R3D network,
   indicating that the improved network structure can extract more
   spatiotemporal features, and finally achieved an accuracy of 95.1\% on
   the HockeyFights test set.},

Title = {Hate Speech Patterns in Social Media: A Methodological Framework and Fat
   Stigma Investigation Incorporating Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling
   and Discourse Analysis},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {Social media offers users an online platform to freely express
   themselves; however, when users post opinionated and offensive comments
   that target certain individuals or communities, this could instigate
   animosity towards them. Widespread condemnation of obesity (fatness) has
   led to much fat stigmatizing content being posted online. A
   methodological framework that uses a novel mixed-method approach for
   unearthing hate speech patterns from large text -based corpora gathered
   from social media is proposed. We explain the use of computer -mediated
   quantitative methods comprising natural language processing techniques
   such as sentiment analysis, emotion analysis and topic modelling, along
   with qualitative discourse analysis. Next, we have applied the framework
   to a corpus of texts on gendered and weight -based data that have been
   extracted from Twitter and Reddit. This assisted in the detection of
   different emotions being expressed, the composition of word frequency
   patterns and the broader fat-based themes underpinning the hateful
   content posted online. The framework has provided a synthesis of
   quantitative and qualitative methods that draw on social science and
   data mining techniques to build real-world knowledge in hate speech
   detection. Current information systems research is limited in its use of
   mixed analytic approaches for studying hate speech in social media. Our
   study therefore contributes to future research by establishing a roadmap
   for conducting mixed-method analyses for better comprehension and
   understanding of hate speech patterns.},

Title = {Hate Speech on Twitter: A Pragmatic Approach to Collect Hateful and
   Offensive Expressions and Perform Hate Speech Detection},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {13825-13835},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of social networks and microblogging websites,
   communication between people from different cultural and psychological
   backgrounds has become more direct, resulting in more and more
   ``cyber{''} conflicts between these people. Consequently, hate speech is
   used more and more, to the point where it has become a serious problem
   invading these open spaces. Hate speech refers to the use of aggressive,
   violent or offensive language, targeting a specific group of people
   sharing a common property, whether this property is their gender (i.e.,
   sexism), their ethnic group or race (i.e., racism) or their believes and
   religion. While most of the online social networks and microblogging
   websites forbid the use of hate speech, the size of these networks and
   websites makes it almost impossible to control all of their content.
   Therefore, arises the necessity to detect such speech automatically and
   filter any content that presents hateful language or language inciting
   to hatred. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect hate
   expressions on Twitter. Our approach is based on unigrams and patterns
   that are automatically collected from the training set. These patterns
   and unigrams are later used, among others, as features to train a
   machine learning algorithm. Our experiments on a test set composed of
   2010 tweets show that our approach reaches an accuracy equal to 87.4\%
   on detecting whether a tweet is offensive or not (binary
   classification), and an accuracy equal to 78.4\% on detecting whether a
   tweet is hateful, offensive, or clean (ternary classification).},

Title = {Data Augmentation for Sentiment Analysis Using Sentence
   Compression-Based SeqGAN With Data Screening},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {99922-99931},
Abstract = {Sentiment analysis refers to the process of automatically identifying
   the emotions expressed by people. Its accuracy is highly dependent on
   the amount of training data. However, it takes time and cost for humans
   to collect a large number of data. Many research works used generative
   models to generate a large amount of data based on a small amount of
   data for sentiment analysis. However, training on long texts and
   inaccurate sentiment information that might be generated are two severe
   challenges. It is difficult to improve the sentiment analysis accuracy
   effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation
   framework based on Sequence generative adversarial networks (SeqGAN) to
   improve the sentiment analysis accuracy when the dataset already has a
   certain amount of data and contains long texts. Penalty-based SeqGAN is
   used to generate high-quality and diversified text data. Long short-term
   memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms are used to conduct
   sentence compression for the training data of SeqGAN. A sentiment
   dictionary is used to retain the sentiment words for compressed data. We
   also propose a data screening method to obtain more accurate data from
   the generated data. The results of the usability, novelty, and diversity
   of the generated data show that the proposed sentence compression method
   can help SeqGAN learn more information from the long text data. The data
   generated by the proposed framework improve the classification accuracy
   of four classifiers applied on two distinct text datasets.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a community-focused drug abuse monitoring and
   supporting system, called DrugTracker, that utilizes social media and
   geospatial data in near real-time. Through the system, users can: (1)
   Detect drug abuse risk behaviors from social media platforms, e.g.,
   Twitter; (2) Analyze drug abuse risk behaviors by querying consolidated
   and live datasets with keywords, spatial entities, and time constraints;
   and (3) Explore the query results and associated data through a
   web-based user interface in thematic choropleth, heatmap, and
   statistical charts. To protect the privacy of the Twitter users, whose
   data is collected, the system automatically hides the re-identification
   elements in tweets and aggregates the geo-tags into areas such as census
   tracts. For the demonstration purpose, our DrugTracker system is
   populated with a database that contains about 10 million tweets from the
   year 2017, that were annotated as drug abuse risk behavior positive by
   our deep learning model.},

Abstract = {The rapid rise of social networking websites and blogging sites not only
   provides freedom of expression or speech, but also allows people to
   express society-prohibited behaviors such as online harassment and
   cyberbullying, which are known as offensive speech or hate speech.
   Despite the fact that various research work has been done on detecting
   hate or abusive speech on social networking websites in the English
   language, the opportunities for research for detecting offensive or
   abusive speech in the Bengali language remain open due to the
   computational resource constraints or the lack of standard-labeled
   datasets for accurate or effective Natural Language Processing (NLP) of
   Bangla language. In this paper, an Explainable AI approach is used for
   analysis as well as for detecting offensive comments or speech in the
   Bengali language is proposed. Moreover, Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) model is used to extract and classify features. Since the Neural
   Network is time-consuming for extracting features from the dataset, our
   proposed approach allows people to save time and effort. In the dataset,
   we classified all user's comments from social media comment sections
   into four categories: religious, personal, geopolitical, and political.
   Our proposed model successfully detects Bangla offensive speeches from
   the dataset (Bengali Hate Speech Dataset) by evaluating Machine Learning
   algorithms like linear and tree-based models and Neural Networks like
   CNN, Bi-LSTM, Conv-LSTM, and SVM models. Moreover, we calculate scores
   for completeness and sufficiency to assess the quality of explanations
   in terms of fidelity, achieving the results with the accuracy of 78\%
   score, significantly outperforming ML and DNN baselines.},

Title = {Characterizing network dynamics of online hate communities around the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Hate speech has long posed a serious problem for the integrity of
   digital platforms. Although significant progress has been made in
   identifying hate speech in its various forms, prevailing computational
   approaches have tended to consider it in isolation from the
   community-based contexts in which it spreads. In this paper, we propose
   a dynamic network framework to characterize hate communities, focusing
   on Twitter conversations related to COVID-19 in the United States and
   the Philippines. While average hate scores remain fairly consistent over
   time, hate communities grow increasingly organized in March, then slowly
   disperse in the succeeding months. This pattern is robust to
   fluctuations in the number of network clusters and average cluster size.
   Infodemiological analysis demonstrates that in both countries, the
   spread of hate speech around COVID-19 features similar reproduction
   rates as other COVID-19 information on Twitter, with spikes in hate
   speech generation at time points with highest community-level
   organization of hate speech. Identity analysis further reveals that hate
   in the US initially targets political figures, then grows predominantly
   racially charged; in the Philippines, targets of hate consistently
   remain political over time. Finally, we demonstrate that higher levels
   of community hate are consistently associated with smaller, more
   isolated, and highly hierarchical network clusters across both contexts.
   This suggests potentially shared structural conditions for the effective
   spread of hate speech in online communities even when functionally
   targeting distinct identity groups. Our findings bear theoretical and
   methodological implications for the scientific study of hate speech and
   understanding the pandemic's broader societal impacts both online and
   offline.},

Title = {The Effect of Phrase Vector Embedding in Explainable Hierarchical

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {The substantial growth in social media users has led to a significant
   increase in code-mixed content on social media platforms. Millions of
   users on these platforms upload pictures and videos and post comments
   regarding their recent or exciting activities. Responding to this
   uploaded content, a few users occasionally use offensive language to
   insult others or specific groups. Social media platforms encounter
   challenges identifying and removing hate speech and objectionable
   content in various languages. Hate speech, in its general sense, refers
   to harmful posts directed at individuals or groups based on factors such
   as their sexuality, religion, community affiliation, disability, and
   others. Typically, offensive language is directly or indirectly utilized
   in hate speech posts to insult someone, causing psychological distress
   to users. In light of this, we propose developing a system to
   automatically block, remove, or report posts written in code-mixed Tamil
   containing hate speech. We have gathered code-mixed Tamil comments from
   Twitter and the Helo App, categorizing them as hate speech and
   classifying their intent. We have identified three categories of hate
   speech intent, namely Targeted Individual (TI), Targeted Group (TG), and
   Others (O). The Targeted Individual (TI) class encompasses posts aimed
   at a specific individual target. At the same time, the Targeted Group
   (TG) category primarily focuses on identifying people based on their
   religion, community, gender, and other characteristics. The Others (O)
   category encompasses untargeted offensive posts and other posts
   containing offensive language. In this context, we propose using a
   phrase-based, Explainable Hierarchical Attention model for hate speech
   detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more
   effective in identifying and explaining hate speech and offensive
   language in social media posts.},

Title = {Detection of Hateful Social Media Content for Arabic Language},

Abstract = {Social media is a common medium for expression of views, discussion,
   sharing of content, and promotion of products and ideas. These views are
   either polite or obscene. The growth of hate speech is one of the
   negative aspects of the medium and its emergence poses risk factors for
   society at various levels. Although there are rules and laws for these
   platforms, they cannot oversee and control all types of content. Thus,
   there is an urgent need to develop modern algorithms to automatically
   detect hateful content on social media. Arab society is not isolated
   from the world, and the usage of social media by its members has
   highlighted the importance of automated systems that help build an
   electronic society free of hate and aggression. This article aims to
   detect hate speech based on Arabic context over the Twitter platform by
   proposing different novel deep learning architectures in order to
   provide a thorough analytical study. Also, a comparative study is
   presented with a different well-known machine learning algorithm, as
   well as other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature to be used
   as a beacon for interested researchers. These models have been applied
   to the Arabic tweets dataset, which included 15K tweets and 14 features.
   After training these models, the results obtained for the top two models
   included an improved bidirectional long short-term memory with an
   accuracy of 92.20\% and a macro F1-score of 92\% and a modified
   convolutional neural network with an accuracy of 92.10\% and a macro
   F1-score of 91\%. The results also showed the superiority of the
   performance of the deep learning models over other models in terms of
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {The flexibility, adaptability, and resilience of even simple brains are
   unmatched by any current technology. Recent unexpected difficulties in
   realising truly autonomous vehicles, making reliable medical diagnoses,
   detecting offensive online content and even just recognising faces, show
   that brains remain significantly functionally more capable than we can
   currently emulate. Fittingly, in recent years we have made significant
   progress identifying computational principles that underlie neural
   function. We are beginning to dispense with the overly simplistic
   stimulus-driven encode/transmit/decode doctrine. Instead we must embrace
   the brain's inherent dynamic complexity and emergent properties and
   explain how plasticity moulds the dynamics to capture useful couplings
   across brain regions and between the brain, the body, and the world.
   While certainly not complete, we have sufficient evidence that a
   synthesis of these ideas could result in a deeper understanding of
   neural computation and which could potentially be used to construct new
   AI technologies with unique capabilities. I discuss the relevant
   neuroscientific principles, the advantages they have for computation,
   and how they can benefit AI. Limitations of current AI are now generally
   recognised. I postulate that we understand enough about the brain to
   immediately offer novel AI formulations.},

Abstract = {The increasing phenomenon of ``cyberhate `` is concerning because of the
   potential social implications of this form of verbal violence, which is
   aimed at already-stigmatized social groups. According to information
   collected by the Ministry of the Interior of Spain, the category of
   sexual orientation and gender identity is subject to the third-highest
   number of registered hate crimes, ranking behind racism/xenophobia and
   ideology. However, most of the existing computational approaches to
   online hate detection simultaneously attempt to address all types of
   discrimination, leading to weaker prototype performances. These
   approaches focus on other reasons for hate-primarily racism and
   xenophobia-and usually focus on English messages. Furthermore, few
   detection models have used manually generated databases as a training
   corpus. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the present
   research sought to overcome these limitations by developing and
   evaluating an automatic detector of hate speech motivated by gender and
   sexual orientation. The focus was Spanish-language posts on Twitter. For
   this purpose, eight predictive models were developed from an ad hoc
   generated training corpus, using shallow modeling and deep learning. The
   evaluation metrics showed that the deep learning algorithm performed
   significantly better than the shallow modeling algorithms, and logistic
   regression yielded the best performance of the shallow algorithms.</p>},

Abstract = {Social media sites facilitate users in posting their own personal
   comments online. Most support free format user posting, with close to
   real-time publishing speeds. However, online posts generated by a public
   user audience carry the risk of containing inappropriate, potentially
   abusive content. To detect such content, the straightforward approach is
   to filter against blacklists of profane terms. However, this lexicon
   filtering approach is prone to problems around word variations and lack
   of context. Although recent methods inspired by machine learning have
   boosted detection accuracies, the lack of gold standard labelled
   datasets limits the development of this approach. In this work, we
   present a dataset of user comments, using crowdsourcing for labelling.
   Since abusive content can be ambiguous and subjective to the individual
   reader, we propose an aggregated mechanism for assessing different
   opinions from different labellers. In addition, instead of the typical
   binary categories of abusive or not, we introduce a third class of
   `undecided' to capture the real life scenario of instances that are
   neither blatantly abusive nor clearly harmless. We have performed
   preliminary experiments on this dataset using best practice techniques
   in text classification. Finally, we have evaluated the detection
   performance of various feature groups, namely syntactic, semantic and
   context-based features. Results show these features can increase our
   classifier performance by 18\% in detection of abusive content.},

Abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) systems are often used for adversarial
   tasks such as detecting spam, abuse, hate speech, and fake news.
   Properly evaluating such systems requires dynamic evaluation that
   searches for weaknesses in the model, rather than a static test set.
   Prior work has evaluated such models on both manually and automatically
   generated examples, but both approaches have limitations: manually
   constructed examples are time-consuming to create and are limited by the
   imagination and intuition of the creators, while automatically
   constructed examples are often ungrammatical or labeled inconsistently.
   We propose to combine human and AI expertise in generating adversarial
   examples, benefiting from humans' expertise in language and automated
   attacks' ability to probe the target system more quickly and thoroughly.
   We present a system that facilitates attack construction, combining
   human judgment with automated attacks to create better attacks more
   efficiently. Preliminary results from our own experimentation suggest
   that human-AI hybrid attacks are more effective than either human-only
   or AI-only attacks. A complete user study to validate these hypotheses
   is still pending.},

Abstract = {Violence detection is a difficult task because it involves analyzing
   video clips from multiple security cameras, which are located in various
   places and operate continuously. When violent crimes occur, a system
   should be able to reliably detect them in real-time and immediately
   alert a surveillance team. Currently, researchers employ deep learning
   models to detect violent behavior. Notably, a large number of deep
   learning approaches are based on extracting spatio-temporal information
   from a video by exploiting either 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs) or multi-stream networks. Despite their success, these techniques
   require a lot of parameters than 2D CNNs and have high computational
   complexity. Therefore, we present a simple spatio-temporal attention
   mechanism combined with a 2D CNN for an effective violence detection
   system. We propose a Squeeze Temporal Attention block that allows a 2D
   CNN to learn spatiotemporal features in videos. This effective block
   uses squeeze and temporal attention modules to summarize a video stream
   into three channels. In addition, we introduce spatial attention and
   feature fusion modules to improve the performance of the proposed
   system. The spatial attention module, Entropy Spatial Module, utilizes
   an entropy filter and frame differences to focus on spatial regions of
   the video with more movement. The fusion module parallelizes two dense
   layers with a 2D CNN to effectively enhance the classifier's
   performance. As a result, our proposed model achieves improved
   performance results in terms of accuracy when compared to Long
   Short-Term Memory, multi-stream networks, and current 3D CNNs.},

Title = {Sarcasm Detection Using Soft Attention-Based Bidirectional Long
   Short-Term Memory Model With Convolution Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {A large community of research has been developed in recent years to
   analyze social media and social networks, with the aim of understanding,
   discovering insights, and exploiting the available information. The
   focus has shifted from conventional polarity classification to
   contemporary application-oriented fine-grained aspects such as,
   emotions, sarcasm, stance, rumor, and hate speech detection in the
   user-generated content. Detecting a sarcastic tone in natural language
   hinders the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. The majority of the
   studies on automatic sarcasm detection emphasize on the use of lexical,
   syntactic, or pragmatic features that are often unequivocally expressed
   through figurative literary devices such as words, emoticons, and
   exclamation marks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model
   called sAtt-BLSTM convNet that is based on the hybrid of soft
   attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (sAtt-BLSTM) and
   convolution neural network (convNet) applying global vectors for word
   representation (GLoVe) for building semantic word embeddings. In
   addition to the feature maps generated by the sAtt-BLSTM,
   punctuation-based auxiliary features are also merged into the convNet.
   The robustness of the proposed model is investigated using balanced
   (tweets from benchmark SemEval 2015 Task 11) and unbalanced
   (approximately 40000 random tweets using the Sarcasm Detector tool with
   15000 sarcastic and 25000 non-sarcastic messages) datasets. An
   experimental study using the training- and test-set accuracy metrics is
   performed to compare the proposed deep neural model with convNet, LSTM,
   and bidirectional LSTM with/without attention and it is observed that
   the novel sAtt-BLSTM convNet model outperforms others with a superior
   sarcasm-classification accuracy of 97.87\% for the Twitter dataset and
   93.71\% for the random-tweet dataset.},

Title = {Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews Using Machine Learning and

Abstract = {Sentiment analysis via artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning
   and large language models (LLMs), is a pivotal tool that classifies
   sentiments within texts as positive, negative, or neutral. It enables
   computers to automatically detect and interpret emotions from textual
   data, covering a spectrum of feelings without direct human intervention.
   Sentiment analysis is integral to marketing research, helping to gauge
   consumer emotions and opinions across various sectors. Its applications
   span analyzing movie reviews, monitoring social media, evaluating
   product feedback, assessing employee sentiments, and identifying hate
   speech. This study explores the application of both traditional machine
   learning and pre-trained LLMs for automated sentiment analysis of
   customer product reviews. The motivation behind this work lies in the
   demand for more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments that can
   drive data-informed business decisions. In this research, we applied
   machine learning-based classifiers, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes,
   and Support Vector Machine, alongside the GPT-4 model to benchmark their
   effectiveness for sentiment analysis. Traditional models show better
   results and efficiency in processing short, concise text, with SVM in
   classifying sentiment of short length comments. However, GPT-4 showed
   better results with more detailed texts, capturing subtle sentiments
   with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores to uniquely identify mixed
   sentiments not found in the simpler models. Conclusively, this study
   shows that LLMs outperform traditional models in context-rich sentiment
   analysis by not only providing accurate sentiment classification but
   also insightful explanations. These results enable LLMs to provide a
   superior tool for customer-centric businesses, which helps actionable
   insights to be derived from any textual data.},

Title = {Multi-Aspect Annotation and Analysis of Nepali Tweets on
   Anti-Establishment Election Discourse},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {143092-143115},
Abstract = {In today's social media-dominated landscape, digital platforms wield
   substantial influence over public opinion, particularly during crucial
   political events such as electoral processes. These platforms become
   hubs for diverse discussions, encompassing topics, reforms, and desired
   changes. Notably, in times of government dissatisfaction, they serve as
   arenas for anti-establishment discourse, highlighting the need to
   analyze public sentiment in these conversations. However, the analysis
   of such discourse is notably scarce, even in high-resource languages,
   and entirely non-existent in the context of the Nepali language. To
   address this critical gap, we present Nepal Anti Establishment discourse
   Tweets (NAET), a novel dataset comprising 4,445 multi-aspect annotated
   Nepali tweets, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of political
   conversations. Our contributions encompass evaluating tweet relevance,
   sentiment, and satire, while also exploring the presence of hate speech,
   identifying its targets, and distinguishing directed and non-directed
   expressions. Additionally, we investigate hope speech, an underexplored
   aspect crucial in the context of anti-establishment discourse, as it
   reflects the aspirations and expectations from new political figures and
   parties. Furthermore, we set NLP-based baselines for all these tasks. To
   ensure a holistic analysis, we also employ topic modeling, a powerful
   technique that helps us identify and understand the prevalent themes and
   patterns emerging from the discourse. Our research thus presents a
   comprehensive and multi-faceted perspective on anti-establishment
   election discourse in a low-resource language setting. The dataset is
   publicly available, facilitating in-depth analysis of political tweets
   in Nepali discourse and further advancing NLP research for the Nepali
   language through labeled data and baselines for various NLP tasks. The
   dataset for this work is made available at
   https://github.com/rkritesh210/NAET.},

Abstract = {Social media and online discussion platforms suffer from the prevalence
   of uncivil behavior, such as harassment and abuse, seeking to curb toxic
   comments. There are several approaches to classifying toxic comments
   automatically. Some of them have more resources and are more advanced in
   English, thus, stimulating the task of translating the text from a
   specific language to English. While researchers have shown evidence that
   this practice is indicated for certain tasks, such as sentiment
   analysis, little is known in the context of toxicity identification. In
   this research, we assess the performance of a freely available model for
   toxic language detection in online comments called Perspective API,
   widely adopted by some famous news media sites to identify different
   toxicity classes in online comments. For that, we obtained comments in
   Portuguese from two Brazilian news media websites during a politically
   polarized situation as a use case. Then, this dataset was translated to
   English and compared to four baseline datasets, two composed of highly
   toxic comments, one in Portuguese and other in English, and two composed
   of neutral comments, also one in Portuguese and other in English - all
   of them in its original language, not translated. Finally,
   human-annotated comments from the news comments dataset were analyzed to
   assess the scores provided by the Perspective API for the original and
   the translated versions. Results indicate that keeping the texts in
   their original language is preferable, even in comparing different
   languages. Nevertheless, if the translated version is strictly
   necessary, ways of dealing with the situation were suggested to preserve
   as much information as possible from the original version.},

Title = {Multilingual Detection of Cyberbullying in Mixed Urdu, Roman Urdu, and
   English Social Media Conversations},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {105201-105210},
Abstract = {Automatic cyberbullying detection in social media is increasingly vital
   due to the integral role of social networks in people's lives and the
   severe impact of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying involves intentional,
   repetitive, aggressive behaviour to harm others online. Among
   Urdu-speaking communities worldwide, it is common to use Urdu, Roman
   Urdu, and English in social media conversations. Existing research and
   detection methods overlook these linguistic dynamics and fail to address
   cyberbullying across these languages comprehensively. Additionally,
   there is no dataset in Urdu and Roman Urdu covering the repetition and
   intent to harm components of cyberbullying. This research addresses this
   gap by developing and annotating a comprehensive dataset capturing
   linguistic variations in cyberbullying instances across Urdu, Roman
   Urdu, and English, incorporating all aspects of cyberbullying. Besides
   proposing a dataset, a framework for detecting cyberbullying has been
   proposed. The framework classifies text messages as aggressive or
   non-aggressive and introduces novel quantitative measures for repetition
   and the level of intent to cause harm. The proposed framework classifies
   cyberbullying by applying thresholds to measures of aggression,
   repetition, and intent to harm, integrating all three aspects. Results
   show aggression detection using fine-tuned m-BERT and MuRIL,
   incorporating measures of repetition and intent to harm on the proposed
   dataset. Additionally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
   impact of repetition and intent to harm on cyberbullying classification.
   The best results on the dataset are achieved using fine-tuned MuRIL with
   a precision of 0.93, recall of 0.92, and an F-measure of 0.92 by
   incorporating quantitative measures of repetition and intent to harm.},

Abstract = {The detection of offensive, hateful content on social media is a
   challenging problem that affects many online users on a daily basis.
   Hateful content is often used to target a group of people based on
   ethnicity, gender, religion and other factors. The hate or contempt
   toward women has been increasing on social platforms. Misogynous content
   detection is especially challenging when textual and visual modalities
   are combined to form a single context, e.g., an overlay text embedded on
   top of an image, also known as meme. In this paper, we present a
   multimodal architecture that combines textual and visual features to
   detect misogynous memes. The proposed architecture is evaluated in the
   SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification
   challenge under the team name TIB-VA. We obtained the best result in the
   TaskB where the challenge is to classify whether a given document is
   misogynous and further identify the following sub-classes: shaming,
   stereotype, objectification, and violence.},

Abstract = {The severity of sustained injury resulting from assault-related violence
   can be minimised by reducing detection time. However, it has been shown
   that human operators perform poorly at detecting events found in video
   footage when presented with simultaneous feeds. We utilise computer
   vision techniques to develop an automated method of abnormal crowd
   detection that can aid a human operator in the detection of violent
   behaviour. We observed that behaviour in city centre environments often
   occurs in crowded areas, resulting in individual actions being occluded
   by other crowd members. We propose a real-time descriptor that models
   crowd dynamics by encoding changes in crowd texture using temporal
   summaries of grey level co-occurrence matrix features. We introduce a
   measure of inter-frame uniformity and demonstrate that the appearance of
   violent behaviour changes in a less uniform manner when compared to
   other types of crowd behaviour. Our proposed method is computationally
   cheap and offers real-time description. Evaluating our method using a
   privately held CCTV dataset and the publicly available Violent Flows,
   UCF Web Abnormality and UMN Abnormal Crowd datasets, we report a
   receiver operating characteristic score of 0.9782, 0.9403, 0.8218 and
   0.9956, respectively.},

Abstract = {Recently, the concept of smart cities has gained prominence, aiming to
   enhance urban efficiency, safety, and quality of life through advanced
   technologies. A critical component of this infrastructure is the
   extensive use of surveillance systems to monitor public spaces for
   violent behavior detection. As the scale of data and models grows,
   large-scale pre-trained models demonstrate remarkable capabilities
   across a wide range of applications. However, adapting these models for
   violence recognition in surveillance videos poses several challenges,
   including the fine-tuning cost, lack of temporal modeling, and inference
   overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient recognition framework
   to adapt pre-trained models for violence behavior recognition, which
   consists of two paths, named spatial path and motion path. Our proposed
   framework allows for real-time parameter updating and real-time
   inference, which is adaptable to various ViT-based pre-trained models.
   Both paths adopt the pipeline of parameter-efficient fine-tuning to
   ensure the real-time performance of the model updating. What's more,
   within the motion path, as multiple frames need to be processed to
   capture temporal features, the real-time performance of the model is a
   challenge. Considering this, to improve the efficiency of inference, we
   compress multiple frames into the size of a single standard image,
   ensuring the real-time performance of inference. Experiments on five
   datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
   performance, efficiently transferring pre-trained large models to
   violence behavior recognition.},

Title = {Towards the Importance of the Type of Deep Neural Network and Employment
   of Pre-trained Word Vectors for Toxicity Detection: An Experimental
   Study},

Abstract = {As a natural consequence of offering many advantages to their users,
   social media platforms have become a part of their daily lives. Recent
   studies emphasize the necessity of an automated way of detecting
   offensive posts in social media since these `toxic' posts have become
   pervasive. To this end, a novel toxic post detection approach based on
   Deep Neural Networks was proposed within this study. Given that several
   word embedding methods exist, we shed light on which word embedding
   method produces better results when employed with the five most common
   types of deep neural networks, namely, Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit),
   Bidirectional Long ShortTerm Memory (BiLSTM), and a combination of CNN
   and BiLSTM. To this end, the word vectors for the given comments were
   obtained through four different methods, namely, (i) Word2vec, (ii)
   fastT ext, (iii) GloVe, and (iv) the Embedding layer of deep neural
   networks. Eventually, a total of twenty benchmark models were proposed
   and both trained and evaluated on a gold standard dataset which consists
   of 16K tweets. According to the experimental result, the best F1 -
   score, 84.844\%, was obtained on the proposed CNN model without
   employing pre-trained word vectors which outperformed the
   state-of-the-art works and implies the effective embedding ability of
   CNNs. Other key findings obtained through the conducted experiments are
   that the models, that constructed word embeddings through the Embedding
   layers, obtained higher F1 - scores and converged much faster than the
   models that utilized pre-trained word vectors.},

Abstract = {Flood of information is produced in a daily basis through the global
   internet usage arising from the online interactive communications among
   users. While this situation contributes significantly to the quality of
   human life, unfortunately it involves enormous dangers, since online
   texts with high toxicity can cause personal attacks, online harassment
   and bullying behaviors. This has triggered both industrial and research
   community in the last few years while there are several attempts to
   identify an efficient model for online toxic comment prediction.
   However, these steps are still in their infancy and new approaches and
   frameworks are required. On parallel, the data explosion that appears
   constantly, makes the construction of new machine learning computational
   tools for managing this information, an imperative need. Thankfully
   advances in hardware, cloud computing and big data management allow the
   development of Deep Learning approaches appearing very promising
   performance so far. For text classification in particular the use of
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently been proposed
   approaching text analytics in a modern manner emphasizing in the
   structure of words in a document. In this work, we employ this approach
   to discover toxic comments in a large pool of documents provided by a
   current Kaggle's competition regarding Wikipedia's talk page edits. To
   justify this decision we choose to compare CNNs against the traditional
   bag-of-words approach for text analysis combined with a selection of
   algorithms proven to be very effective in text classification. The
   reported results provide enough evidence that CNN enhance toxic comment
   classification reinforcing research interest towards this direction.},

Abstract = {Social media has become a place for discussion and debate on
   controversial topics, and thus provides an opportunity to influence
   public opinion. This possibility has given rise to a specific behavior
   known as trolling, which can be found in almost every discussion that
   includes emotionally appealing topics. A troll is an individual who
   shares inflammatory, extraneous or off-topic messages in social media,
   with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response
   or otherwise disrupting on-topic discussion. Trolling is thus a useful
   tool for any organization willing to force a discussion off-track in the
   situations when one has no proper facts to back one's arguments. In this
   paper, the analysis of trolling is based on public discussion
   stakeholder classification by Luoma-Aho (2015), including positively
   engaged faith-holders, negatively engaged hateholders, and fakeholders.
   Trolls can be considered as either hateholders (humans) or fakeholders
   (bots or cyborgs). It is stated by Luoma-Aho that the influence of a
   fakeholder appears larger than it really is in practice, but tools for
   analyzing the impact are not provided in her work. This paper continues
   the work by Paavola and Jalonen (2015), who examined in their paper
   whether sentiment analysis could be utilized in detecting trolling
   behavior. It was concluded that sentiment analysis as such cannot detect
   trolls, but results indicated that social media analytics tools can
   generally be utilized for this task. In this paper the work continues
   with automatic detection of bots, which facilitates the analysis of
   fakeholder communication's impact. The automatic bot detection feature
   is implemented in the sentiment analysis tool in order to remove the
   noise in a discussion.},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is widely used to moderate online content. Despite
   its scalability relative to human moderation, the use of ML introduces
   unique challenges to content moderation. One such challenge is
   predictive multiplicity: multiple competing models for content
   classification may perform equally well on average, yet assign
   conflicting predictions to the same content. This multiplicity can
   result from seemingly innocuous choices made during training, which do
   not meaningfully change the accuracy of the ML model, but can
   nevertheless change what the model gets wrong. We experimentally
   demonstrate how content moderation tools can arbitrarily classify
   samples as ``toxic,{''} leading to arbitrary restrictions on speech. We
   use the principles set by the International Covenant on Civil and
   Political Rights (ICCPR), namely freedom of expression,
   non-discrimination, and procedural justice to interpret the effects of
   these findings in terms of Human Rights. We analyze (i) the extent of
   predictive multiplicity among popular state-of-the-art LLMs used for
   detecting ``toxic{''} content; (ii) the disparate impact of this
   arbitrariness across social groups; and (iii) the magnitude of model
   multiplicity on content that is unanimously recognized as toxic by human
   annotators. Our findings indicate that the up-scaled algorithmic
   moderation risks legitimizing an ``algorithmic leviathan{''}, where an
   algorithm disproportionately manages human rights. To mitigate such
   risks, our study underscores the need to identify and increase the
   transparency of arbitrariness in content moderation applications. Our
   findings have implications to content moderation and intermediary
   liability laws being discussed and passed in many countries, such as the
   Digital Services Act in the European Union, the Online Safety Act in the
   United Kingdom, and the recent TSE resolutions in Brazil.},

Title = {SocialHaterBERT: A dichotomous approach for automatically detecting hate
   speech on Twitter through textual analysis and user profiles},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {216},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Social media platforms have evolved into an online representation of our
   social interactions. We may use the resources they provide to analyze
   phenomena that occur within them, such as the development and
   viralization of offensive and hostile content. In today's polarized
   world, the escalating nature of this behavior is cause for concern in
   modern society. This research includes an in-depth examination of
   previous efforts and strategies for detecting and preventing hateful
   content on the social network Twitter, as well as a novel classification
   approach based on users' profiles, related social environment and
   generated tweets. This paper's contribution is threefold: (i) an
   improvement in the performance of the HaterNet algorithm, an expert
   system developed in collaboration with the Spanish National Office
   Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security
   (Ministry of the Interior) that is capable of identifying and monitoring
   the evolution of hate speech on Twitter using an LTSM + MLP neural
   network architecture. To that end, a model based on BERT, HaterBERT, has
   been created and tested using HaterNet's public dataset, providing
   results that show a significant improvement; (ii) A methodology to
   create a user database in the form of a relational network to infer
   textual and centrality features. This contribution, SocialGraph, has
   been independently tested with various traditional Machine Learning and
   Deep Learning algorithms, demonstrating its usefulness in spotting
   haters; (iii) a final model, SocialHaterBERT, that integrates the
   previous two approaches by analyzing features other than those inherent
   in the text. Experiment results reveal that this last contribution
   greatly improves outcomes, establishing a new field of study that
   transcends textual boundaries, paving the way for future research in
   coupled models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is a prominent issue that affects many people within their
   lifetime. In this paper we explore the use of Machine Learning (ML) and
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to support automatic
   detection of cyberbullying. The paper discusses first the significance
   of cyberbullying and its relationship to cybersecurity. Then, in order
   to illustrate the automatic detection approach and its integration into
   a web application, we considered a benchmark dataset, the Offensive
   Language Identification Dataset (OLID). This is an annotated large-scale
   dataset with approximate 14,000 English tweets, that was used in various
   works for detecting offensive posts in social media, predicting their
   type and target. To solve the classification problems associated with
   OLID dataset, nine supervised models were developed for each task of the
   dataset. We used the TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)
   feature selection and GridSearchCV to find the optimum parameters for
   each of the ML algorithms. Evaluation metrics, such as build time,
   accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to compare the ML
   techniques. The Random Forest models achieved 82, 90, and 61\% in
   accuracy for the tasks associated with the dataset, which were the best
   performing algorithms supported by the other metrics. The Random Forest
   models that achieved the best performance, were integrated within a
   Flask web application, publicly available. This serves as proof of
   concept, allowing users to test the classifier. The paper explains how a
   developed ML model can be integrated into a web application.
   Furthermore, one can develop an API for handling larger and more
   frequent data requests or integrate in a social media platform the
   classifier.},

Title = {Characterizing Discourse and Engagement Across Topics of Misinformation
   on Twitter},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {115002-115010},
Abstract = {In recent years, online misinformation has become increasingly
   prevalent, leading to significant issues such as political polarisation
   and distrust of genuine information. Misinformation on social media
   platforms affects various aspects of society, including health and
   politics, and can take many forms, such as text and images. However,
   current studies mainly focus on analysing singular topics and
   modalities, without considering the heterogeneity of the issue. Our
   research aimed to examine the relationship between visual elements and
   engagement, as well as the relationship between sentiment analysis, hate
   speech, and bots on a variety of topics on the Twitter social media
   platform Twitter. We labelled 12,581 misinformation posts that were
   manually modelled into a topic hierarchy. We then analysed these posts,
   including their sentiments, the prevalence of hate speech, and bot
   activity on different topics. The results revealed that political
   misinformation tends to contain more hate speech than COVID-19
   misinformation and that political misinformation also has a higher
   number of bots. Furthermore, the findings suggest that misinformation
   online with more than 40\% negative sentences can have a high level of
   hate speech identified for both tweets and replies. This study provides
   detailed information on topics and the volume of misinformation on
   social media platforms, and the findings can be used to develop more
   advanced detection systems and support further analysis. Our findings
   can help policy makers understand what kind of online misinformation has
   been spreading on Twitter and how to plan campaigns to make users more
   aware of how to spot its various features in an online user-to-user
   Twitter environment.},

Abstract = {Increased social media use has contributed to the greater prevalence of
   abusive, rude, and offensive textual comments. Machine learning models
   have been developed to detect toxic comments online, yet these models
   tend to show biases against users with marginalized or minority
   identities (e.g., females and African Americans). Established research
   in debiasing toxicity classifiers often (1) takes a static or batch
   approach, assuming that all information is available and then making a
   one-time decision; and (2) uses a generic strategy to mitigate different
   biases (e.g., gender and racial biases) that assumes the biases are
   independent of one another. However, in real scenarios, the input
   typically arrives as a sequence of comments/words over time instead of
   all at once. Thus, decisions based on partial information must be made
   while additional input is arriving. Moreover, social bias is complex by
   nature. Each type of bias is defined within its unique context, which,
   consistent with intersectionality theory within the social sciences,
   might be correlated with the contexts of other forms of bias. In this
   work, we consider debiasing toxicity detection as a sequential
   decision-making process where different biases can be interdependent. In
   particular, we study debiasing toxicity detection with two aims: (1) to
   examine whether different biases tend to correlate with each other; and
   (2) to investigate how to jointly mitigate these correlated biases in an
   interactive manner to minimize the total amount of bias. At the core of
   our approach is a framework built upon theories of sequential Markov
   Decision Processes that seeks to maximize the prediction accuracy and
   minimize the bias measures tailored to individual biases. Evaluations on
   two benchmark datasets empirically validate the hypothesis that biases
   tend to be correlated and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
   sequential debiasing strategy.},

Abstract = {The exponential growth of social media platforms, such as Facebook,
   Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok, has revolutionized communication and
   content publication in human society. Users on these platforms can
   publish multimedia content that delivers information via the combination
   of text, audio, images, and video. Meanwhile, the multimedia content
   release facility has been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic
   content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography.
   To this end, content moderation software has been widely deployed on
   these platforms to detect and blocks toxic content. However, due to the
   complexity of content moderation models and the difficulty of
   understanding information across multiple modalities, existing content
   moderation software can fail to detect toxic content, which often leads
   to extremely negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental
   health).
   We introduce Semantic Fusion, a general, effective methodology for
   validating multimedia content moderation software. Our key idea is to
   fuse two or more existing single-modal inputs (e.g., a textual sentence
   and an image) into a new input that combines the semantics of its
   ancestors in a novel manner and has toxic nature by construction. This
   fused input is then used for validating multimedia content moderation
   software. We realized Semantic Fusion as DUO, a practical content
   moderation software testing tool. In our evaluation, we employ DUO to
   test five commercial content moderation software and two
   state-of-the-art models against three kinds of toxic contents. The
   results show that DUO achieves up to 100\% error finding rate (EFR) when
   testing moderation software and it obtains up to 94.1\% EFR when testing
   the state-of-the-art models. In addition, we leverage the test cases
   generated by DUO to retrain the two models we explored, which largely
   improves model robustness (2.5\%similar to 5.7\% EFR) while maintaining
   the accuracy on the original test set.},

Abstract = {Dialogue models trained on human conversations inadvertently learn to
   generate toxic responses. In addition to producing explicitly offensive
   utterances, these models can also implicitly insult a group or
   individual by aligning themselves with an offensive statement. To better
   understand the dynamics of contextually offensive language, we
   investigate the stance of dialogue model responses in offensive Reddit
   conversations. Specifically, we create TOXICHAT, a crowd-annotated
   dataset of 2,000 Reddit threads and model responses labeled with
   offensive language and stance. Our analysis reveals that 42\% of human
   responses agree with toxic comments, whereas only 13\% agree with safe
   comments. This undesirable behavior is learned by neural dialogue
   models, such as DialoGPT, which we show are two times more likely to
   agree with offensive comments. To enable automatic detection of
   offensive language, we fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers on
   TOXICHAT that achieve 0.71 F-1 for offensive labels and 0.53 Macro-F-1
   for stance labels. Finally, we quantify the effectiveness of
   controllable text generation (CTG) methods to mitigate the tendency of
   neural dialogue models to agree with offensive comments. Compared to the
   baseline, our best CTG model achieves a 19\% reduction in agreement with
   offensive comments and produces 29\% fewer offensive replies. Our work
   highlights the need for further efforts to characterize and analyze
   inappropriate behavior in dialogue models, in order to help make them
   safer.(1)},

Abstract = {With an ever growing number of smartphone users, the mobile gaming
   industry is booming and reached more than 2.6 billion players worldwide
   in 2020. While some mobile games charge a relatively modest fee to be
   played, the vast majority are free and rely exclusively on ads or
   tracking for their revenue streams. Over the years, Google and Apple
   have tightened their privacy requirements for apps. They perform
   thorough app scanning to detect abusive behaviours and require
   developers to provide a privacy policy on how they collect and handle
   user data. Yet, little is known about the data collection that fuels the
   advertising and tracking industry behind mobile games. Players can see
   the ads that are presented to them but they may not be aware of the
   invisible trackers that collect valuable data in the background.
   In this study, we aim to shine a light on the tracking ecosystem in
   mobile games on Android and understand how different monetization models
   can impact user privacy. We introduce a pipeline that collects both free
   and paid games and we use the static analysis provided by the Exodus
   audit platform to detect the trackers present in them. We analyse a
   total of 6, 751 games, including 396 paid games. Our results show that
   paying for a game does not necessarily shield users from data
   collection. We find that 87\% of free games include at least one
   tracker, compared to 65\% of paid games that do. On average, free games
   have 3.4 times more trackers and request twice more dangerous
   permissions than paid games. We also notice that the genre of the game
   and its targeted audience impact the number of trackers. Games in the
   Casual category presents the most trackers while those in the
   Educational one have the least.},

Title = {Offensive Language Detection in Arabic Social Networks Using
   Evolutionary-Based Classifiers Learned From Fine-Tuned Embeddings},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {75018-75039},
Abstract = {Social networks facilitate communication between people from all over
   the world. Unfortunately, the excessive use of social networks leads to
   the rise of antisocial behaviors such as the spread of online offensive
   language, cyberbullying (CB), and hate speech (HS). Therefore,
   abusive\textbackslash{}offensive and hate detection become a crucial
   part of cyberharassment. Manual detection of cyberharassment is
   cumbersome, slow, and not even feasible in rapidly growing data. In this
   study, we addressed the challenges of automatic detection of the
   offensive tweets in the Arabic language. The main contribution of this
   study is to design and implement an intelligent prediction system
   encompassing a two-stage optimization approach to identify and classify
   the offensive from the non-offensive text. In the first stage, the
   proposed approach fine-tuned the pre-trained word embedding models by
   training them for several epochs on the training dataset. The embeddings
   of the vocabularies in the new dataset are trained and added to the old
   embeddings. While in the second stage, it employed a hybrid approach of
   two classifiers, namely XGBoost and SVM, and a genetic algorithm (GA) to
   mitigate the drawback of the classifiers in finding the optimal
   hyperparameter values to run the proposed approach. We tested the
   proposed approach on Arabic Cyberbullying Corpus (ArCybC), which
   contains tweets collected from four Twitter domains: gaming, sports,
   news, and celebrities. The ArCybC dataset has four categories: sexual,
   racial, intelligence, and appearance. The proposed approach produced
   superior results, in which the SVM algorithm with the Aravec SkipGram
   word embedding model achieved an accuracy rate of 88.2\% and an F1-score
   rate of 87.8\%.},

Abstract = {Entitlement has been identified as a potentially valuable employee
   characteristic in the prediction of computer abuse but has not been
   studied systematically in the IS domain. We introduce the construct of
   technological entitlement as the persistent sense of being more
   deserving of technological resources, uses, and privileges compared to
   other employees. Adapting a model of general entitlement to the work
   technology context, we theorize that technological entitlement predicts
   computer abuse and that this relationship is amplified by perceptions of
   technology restriction. After developing and validating a scale to
   measure technological entitlement, we conduct three studies with working
   adult samples to test our hypotheses. In Study 1 (n = 187), using a
   behavioral design, we find that technological entitlement predicts
   computer abuse behavior (beyond general entitlement) and that this
   relationship is stronger when employees perceive organizational
   restrictions on technology usage. We replicate these findings in Study 2
   (n = 339) with an experiment. In Study 3 (n = 156), we manipulate the
   context of restrictiveness within our experimental vignette to establish
   the generalizability of our moderator. We discuss how technological
   entitlement helps explain existing inconsistencies in the effectiveness
   of deterrence measures as well as other theoretical and practical
   implications of our work.},

Abstract = {The extensive expansion of surveillance has enabled the identification
   of numerous threats in advance. By examining surveillance footage,
   violent activities can be identified in time to prevent disastrous
   repercussions. In this paper, a method for detecting violence is
   proposed. Initially, GoogLeNet is chosen for feature extraction in time
   and space based on the loss of pre-trained CNN feature extraction
   results and the running efficiency of each model. Some convolutional
   layers of GoogLeNet are frozen in accordance with the concept of
   migration learning to meet the demand for accurate feature extraction on
   tiny data sets. Multi-head Attention (MHA) was used in order to increase
   the model's precision and operating efficiency by focusing on key
   features. The results are then input into the long short-term memory
   (LSTM) violence detection model. In addition, an ablation study on the
   input characteristics was carried out, comparing the outcomes with and
   without the MHA. It revealed that including the MHA enhanced the
   outcomes by 7.31\%. Finally, the model obtains 100\% accuracy on the
   Daily Violence and Movies Fight datasets and 94.36\% accuracy on the
   RWF-2000 dataset, which is commendable. As can be seen, our model on
   daily violence and Movies Fight has produced the best results, and it is
   4\% more accurate than the best method currently available for RWF-2000.
   To put the model in this paper to use in practice, we also created an
   Android application (APP). Violence in hospitals is common, but not all
   hospitals can deal with it promptly. Our APP can detect violent behavior
   in hospital surveillance videos in real time and promptly alert security
   officers. The usefulness is excellent.},

Abstract = {Online social media (OSM) communications sometimes turn into hate-filled
   and offensive comments or arguments. It not just disrupts the social
   fabric online, but also leads to hate, violence, and crime, in the real
   physical world in worst scenarios. The existing content moderation
   practices of OSM platforms often fail to control the online hate. In
   this article, we develop a deep learning model called BiCapsHate to
   detect hate speech (HS) in OSM posts. The model consists of five layers
   of deep neural networks. It starts with an input layer to process the
   input text and follows on to an embedding layer to embed the text into a
   numeric representation. A BiCaps layer then learns the sequential and
   linguistic contextual representations, a dense layer prepares the model
   for final classification, and lastly the output layer produces the
   resulting class as either hate or non-HS (NHS). The BiCaps layer, being
   the most important component, effectively learns the contextual
   information with respect to different orientations in both forward and
   backward directions of the input text via capsule networks. It is
   further aided by our rich set of hand-crafted shallow and deep auxiliary
   features including the Hatebase lexicon, making the model well-informed.
   We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets to
   demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed BiCapsHate model. In the
   overall results, we outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods
   including fBERT, HateBERT, and ToxicBERT. BiCapsHate achieves up to 94\%
   and 92\% f-score on balanced and imbalanced datasets, respectively. Our
   complete source code is publicly available at GitHub repository

Abstract = {Freedom of expression found on social media has various pros and cons.
   Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is also a major issue in social media. As a
   part of GBV, hate speech against women is on the rise on all social
   media. There are some lapses available in the stand-alone classifiers in
   detecting such speech, and the performance of ensemble classifiers is
   much better. Also, many research works have focused on common hate
   speech datasets. Hate speech against women has been used in very few
   research activities. But such hate speech is very dangerous. As a
   result, this research employs, Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression
   (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to compute
   metrics and performances and then use those algorithms to create a
   voting classifier to develop a more accurate model for detecting hate
   speech against at women. Two phases were used in this study. RF, LR, DT,
   and LSTM were used as foundation stand-alone classifiers in the first
   phase of the ensemble procedure. In Phase Two, the weights of the
   second-level classifier were estimated using first-level classifiers.
   Hate speech against women was detected using an open-source \#MeToo
   dataset that was utilized for training and testing by the researchers.
   The dataset is publicly available on GitHub which was uploaded by Nazmus
   Sakib. This dataset consists of 278,765 \#MeToo movement posts on social
   media. It clearly shows that the proposed voting classifier model has
   the highest values in all metrics including accuracy (89\%). When we
   check the strongly positive classification, the proposed model has
   performed well in precision (0.90), recall (0.91), and F-measures (0.90)
   and it can calculate strong positive hate speech more efficiently than
   other stand-alone classifiers. This voting model takes more time to
   train since it has multiple models inside. By training it for more
   epochs, we can further increase accuracy.},

Abstract = {In this study, we introduce a newmethod to address the pressing issue of
   school violence using Artificial Intelligence (AI). School violence is a
   critical issue that affects the safety and well-being of students,
   teachers, and the school community as a whole. Violent behaviors, such
   as bullying, physical assaults, and weapon use, can have long-term
   effects on students' psychological health and academic performance. To
   reduce these issues, we developed a lightweight Deep Learning model that
   can be integrated into a school's surveillance camera system to quickly
   detect violent fighting behaviors for timely intervention by school
   staff. The proposed FightNet model consists of three components:
   MobileNetV2 backbone, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) neck, and Centernet
   Object as a Point (COaP) head. By optimizing the hyperparameters of the
   model to extract keypoints in image frames from the COCO dataset, we
   applied an LSTM model to determine the temporal dependence of actions
   and classify them as ``fighting{''} or ``normal{''} using the UBI-Fights
   dataset. The FightNet model achieved mAP@0.5 of 45.34\% and mAP@0.95 of
   55.89\% in estimating keypoints, and 72.68\% accuracy and 71.69\%
   F1-score in predicting actions. Based on these results, we conclude that
   the proposed model can effectively address the issue of school violence.},

Abstract = {Social media and other platforms rely on automated detection of abusive
   content to help combat disinformation, harassment, and abuse. One common
   approach is to check user content for similarity against a server-side
   database of problematic items. However, this method fundamentally
   endangers user privacy. Instead, we target client-side detection,
   notifying only the users when such matches occur to warn them against
   abusive content.
   Our solution is based on privacy-preserving similarity testing. Existing
   approaches rely on expensive cryptographic protocols that do not scale
   well to large databases and may sacrifice the correctness of the
   matching. To contend with this challenge, we propose and formalize the
   concept of similarity-based bucketization (SBB). With SBB, a client
   reveals a small amount of information to a database-holding server so
   that it can generate a bucket of potentially similar items. The bucket
   is small enough for efficient application of privacy-preserving
   protocols for similarity. To analyze the privacy risk of the revealed
   information, we introduce a framework for measuring an adversary's
   confidence in inferring a predicate about the client input correctly. We
   develop a practical SBB protocol for image content, and evaluate its
   client privacy guarantee with real-world social media data. We then
   combine SBB with various similarity protocols, showing that the
   combination with SBB provides a speedup of at least 29 x on large-scale
   databases compared to that without, while retaining correctness of over
   95\%.},

Abstract = {In traditional machine learning, classifiers training is typically
   undertaken in the setting of single-task learning, so the trained
   classifier can discriminate between different classes. However, this
   must be based on the assumption that different classes are mutually
   exclusive. In real applications, the above assumption does not always
   hold. For example, the same book may belong to multiple subjects. From
   this point of view, researchers were motivated to formulate multi-label
   learning problems. In this context, each instance can be assigned
   multiple labels but the classifiers training is still typically
   undertaken in the setting of single-task learning. When probabilistic
   approaches are adopted for classifiers training, multi-task learning can
   be enabled through transformation of a multi-labelled data set into
   several binary data sets. The above data transformation could usually
   result in the class imbalance issue. Without the above data
   transformation, multi-labelling of data results in an exponential
   increase of the number of classes, leading to fewer instances for each
   class and a higher difficulty for identifying each class. In addition,
   multi-labelling of data is very time consuming and expensive in some
   application areas, such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we
   introduce a novel formulation of the hate speech type identification
   problem in the setting of multi-task learning through our proposed fuzzy
   ensemble approach. In this setting, single-labelled data can be used for
   semi-supervised multi-label learning and two new metrics (detection rate
   and irrelevance rate) are thus proposed to measure more effectively the
   performance for this kind of learning tasks. We report an experimental
   study on identification of four types of hate speech, namely: religion,
   race, disability and sexual orientation. The experimental results show
   that our proposed fuzzy ensemble approach outperforms other popular
   probabilistic approaches, with an overall detection rate of 0.93.},

Abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging tool that allow the creation of big data
   through short digital contents. This study provides a survey of machine
   learning techniques for hate speech classification from Twitter data
   streams. Hate speech classification in Twitter data streams has remain a
   vibrant research focus, but little research efforts have been devoted to
   the design of a generic metadata architecture, threshold settings and
   fragmentation issues. Hate speech classification techniques presented in
   literature address some of the challenges inherent in Twitter data
   streams but limited in the aforementioned issues. This study presented
   collection of hate speech benchmarks datasets suitable for testing the
   efficiency of classification models. This study also presented the pros
   and cons for single and hybrid machine learning methods in hate speech
   classification. The summary of performance evaluation for the surveyed
   machine learning methods was also presented. The study also presented a
   generic metadata architecture for hate speech classification in Twitter
   to tackle issues with Twitter data streams. The developed generic
   metadata architecture was observed to performed better across all
   evaluation metrics for hate speech detection having 0.95, 0.93, 0.92 and
   0.93 for accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score respectively, when
   compared to similar methods. Similarly, the developed generic metadata
   architecture for hate speech sentiment classification performed better
   with F1-score of 91.5\% compared to related methods. The developed
   generic metadata architecture also indicates a more perfect test having
   an AUC of 0.97, when compared to similar methods. The statistical
   validation of results points out the efficiency of the developed system.
   Finally, the results also showed that the developed system is very good
   for automatic topic detection and categorization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Revisiting vision-based violence detection in videos: A critical
   analysis},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {597},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {An ever-increasing installation of surveillance cameras at different
   places for ensuring public safety, security and asset protection has
   triggered the need for intelligent video surveillance to monitor the
   people and their behavior. Violence detection is a prominent application
   of intelligent surveillance as it plays a vital role in public safety,
   behavior monitoring, and law enforcement. It deals with identifying
   whether the violent event or behavior occurred in video sequence or not.
   Various researchers have developed different techniques and features for
   the detection of violence in recent years. The purpose of this paper is
   to provide an expository study of various state-of-the-art approaches
   for detecting violence in videos. It is evident from the ongoing effort
   in this field and with the advancement in computer vision technology,
   previous approaches get surpassed and new methods and features always
   keep on developing. Therefore, in order to complement ongoing research,
   it is also imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of different
   works from time to time. In this survey, each work has been critically
   analyzed, along with its pros and cons. The violence detection
   techniques have been divided under three categories: handcrafted
   features based, deep learning and hybrid violence detection approaches
   that have been extensively reviewed in various sub-categories. The major
   challenges faced by researchers and the steps involved in the process of
   violence detection are also discussed. Moreover, unlike typical
   practices of comparing the performance of models within same datasets,
   we examined a few models for cross-dataset assessment and revealed their
   limited generalization. This emphasizes the crucial need for robust
   model generalization to ensure efficacy across varied real-world
   scenarios. Finally, the paper carried out a discussion of various
   research gaps in the current approaches and the possible solutions to be
   taken to resolve them, laying a solid foundation for future work in this
   area.},

Abstract = {Natural language processing systems have attracted much interest of the
   industry. This branch of study is composed of some applications such as
   machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
   question and answer, and others. Word embeddings (i.e., continuous word
   representations) are an essential module for those applications
   generally used as word representation to machine learning models. Some
   popular methods to train word embeddings are GloVe and Word2Vec. They
   achieve good word representations, despite limitations: both ignore
   morphological information of the words and consider only one
   representation vector for each word. This approach implies the word
   embeddings does not consider different word contexts properly and are
   unaware of its inner structure. To mitigate this problem, the other word
   embeddings method FastText represents each word as a bag of characters
   n-grams. Hence, a continuous vector describes each n-gram, and the final
   word representation is the sum of its characters n-grams vectors.
   Nevertheless, the use of all n-grams character of a word is a poor
   approach since some n-grams have no semantic relation with their words
   and increase the amount of potentially useless information. This
   approach also increase the training phase time. In this work, we propose
   a new method for training word embeddings, and its goal is to replace
   the FastText bag of character n-grams for a bag of word morphemes
   through the morphological analysis of the word. Thus, words with similar
   context and morphemes are represented by vectors close to each other. To
   evaluate our new approach, we performed intrinsic evaluations
   considering 15 different tasks, and the results show a competitive
   performance compared to FastText. Moreover, the proposed model is 40\%
   faster than FastText in the training phase. We also outperform the
   baseline approaches in extrinsic evaluations through Hate speech
   detection and NER tasks using different scenarios.},

Title = {Emojis as anchors to detect Arabic offensive language and hate speech},
Journal = {NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1436-1457},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We introduce a generic, language-independent method to collect a large
   percentage of offensive and hate tweets regardless of their topics or
   genres. We harness the extralinguistic information embedded in the
   emojis to collect a large number of offensive tweets. We apply the
   proposed method on Arabic tweets and compare it with English
   tweets-analyzing key cultural differences. We observed a constant usage
   of these emojis to represent offensiveness throughout different
   timespans on Twitter. We manually annotate and publicly release the
   largest Arabic dataset for offensive, fine-grained hate speech, vulgar,
   and violence content. Furthermore, we benchmark the dataset for
   detecting offensiveness and hate speech using different transformer
   architectures and perform in-depth linguistic analysis. We evaluate our
   models on external datasets-a Twitter dataset collected using a
   completely different method, and a multi-platform dataset containing
   comments from Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, for assessing
   generalization capability. Competitive results on these datasets suggest
   that the data collected using our method capture universal
   characteristics of offensive language. Our findings also highlight the
   common words used in offensive communications, common targets for hate

Title = {Monitoring Cyber SentiHate Social Behavior During COVID-19 Pandemic in
   North America},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {91184-91208},
Abstract = {With communications being shifted to online social networks (OSNs) as a
   result of travel and social restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic, the
   need has arisen for discovering emerging trends and concerns formed
   during the pandemic as well as understanding the corresponding online
   social behavior that reflects its offline settings. The online
   connectivity of devices through social media is one example of Internet
   of Things (IoT) in which a two-way communication between societies and
   officials, could be created. Therefore, it is possible to monitor
   people's behavior through OSNs, especially during pandemics, to prevent
   potential social and psychological instabilities that might lead to
   undesired consequences. This is particularly crucial for governmental
   and non-governmental organizations to ensure the stability and
   well-being in societies. In response, we propose a pandemic-friendly
   real-time framework for monitoring cyber social behavior by utilizing
   unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Two BERT-based
   supervised classifiers are trained and constructed to analyze two types
   of online social behaviors, hate and sentiment. Unsupervised framework
   is proposed for OSNs data exploration and coherent interpretation that
   is used as a complementary tool to facilitate the analysis of online
   social behaviors during pandemics. Extensive experimentation and
   evaluation have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed work. Our results have shown superior performance of our
   BERT-based models in two classification tasks: 1) binary classification
   for hate behavior detection and 2) multi-class classification for
   sentiment behavior detection. In addition to our experimentation
   results, our large-scale analysis of COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated
   the capability of our unsupervised framework for concerns and trends
   discoveries using OSNs data, along with reliability in automatically and
   dynamically providing phrase-based interpenetration of the inferred
   trends and concerns. This paper provides a twelve-month comparison
   analysis of data discoveries and online social behavior between Canada
   and USA during COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {The mass adoption of social media has brought with it the most
   undesirable aspects of human nature, namely the need to abuse one's
   fellow kind for sometimes difficult to understand reasons. There has
   been severe pressure on law enforcement agencies to respond to this
   Internet abuse, commonly called Internet trolling. Equally, there has
   been demands made of social media companies to better police the content
   on their platforms. There is also the option of civil action for those
   who have been targeted by the `trolls' who post the abusive comments.
   This paper suggests understanding UK case law in relation to Internet
   trolling and cyber-harassment should be done through the prism of the
   French legal concepts of bleasure (i.e. blessure) and motif. The paper
   provides a framework for those involved in multimedia forensics to
   abstract information from identified abusive content (i.e. motifs) to
   determine whether it would be reasonable to say that such messages
   harmed a person (i.e. caused a bleasure). Using a corpus linguistics
   approach, the paper identifies abusive posts made against prominent
   women public figures on Twitter and newsblogs in the last three years,
   namely Sally Bercow, Caroline Criado-Perez, Esther McVay and Salma
   Yaqoob. The paper finds that it is possible to systematically abstract
   data from social media platforms that both show that an offence has
   happened (i.e. actus reus, motif), that a person has been harmed (i.e.
   malum reus, bleasure), and whether it has occurred, or is likely to

Abstract = {Curbing hate speech is undoubtedly a major challenge for online
   microblogging platforms like Twitter. While there have been studies
   around hate speech detection, it is not clear how hate speech finds its
   way into an online discussion. It is important for a content moderator
   to not only identify which tweet is hateful, but also to predict which
   tweet will be responsible for accumulating hate speech. This would help
   in prioritizing tweets that need constant monitoring. Our analysis
   reveals that for hate speech to manifest in an ongoing discussion, the
   source tweet may not necessarily be hateful; rather, there are plenty of
   such non-hateful tweets which gradually invoke hateful replies,
   resulting in the entire reply threads becoming provocative.
   In this paper, we define a novel problem - given a source tweet and a
   few of its initial replies, the task is to forecast the hate intensity
   of upcoming replies. To this end, we curate a novel dataset constituting
   similar to 4.5k contemporary tweets and their entire reply threads. Our
   preliminary analysis confirms that the evolution patterns along time of
   hate intensity among reply threads have highly diverse patterns, and
   there is no significant correlation between the hate intensity of the
   source tweets and that of their reply threads. We employ seven
   state-of-the-art dynamic models (either statistical signal processing or
   deep learning based) and show that they fail badly to forecast the hate
   intensity. We then propose DESSERT, a novel deep state-space model that
   leverages the function approximation capability of deep neural networks
   with the capacity to quantify the uncertainty of statistical signal
   processing models. Exhaustive experiments and ablation study show that
   DESSERT outperforms all the baselines substantially. Further, its
   deployment in an advanced AI platform designed to monitor real-world
   problematic hateful content has improved the aggregated insights
   extracted for countering the spread of online harms.},

Abstract = {The advances in technical evolution have given rise to a serious problem
   of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication
   to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or
   threatening nature. Social networking sites in particular Twitter is
   becoming a platform for this type of bullying. Machine learning (ML)
   techniques have been widely used to detect cyberbullying through
   detecting some language patterns that are exploited by bullies to attack
   their victims. Sentiment Analysis (SA) of text can also contribute
   useful features in detecting offensive or abusive content. Deep learning
   specifically the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been used to
   improve the performance of feature extraction during the detection of
   cyberbullying process. In. this research, a SA model is proposed for
   recognizing cyberbullying tweets in Twitter web-based media.
   Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive
   Bayes (NB) are utilized in this model as supervised ML classifiers. The
   aftereffects of the analyses led on this model demonstrated empowering
   results when a higher n-grams language models are applied on such tweets
   in comparison with comparable past exploration. Moreover, the results
   showed that CNN classifiers have outperformed NB and SVM classifiers in
   several measures.},

Abstract = {Prior to the innovation of information communication technologies (ICT),
   social interactions evolved within small cultural boundaries such as geo
   spatial locations. The recent developments of communication technologies
   have considerably transcended the temporal and spatial limitations of
   traditional communications. These social technologies have created a
   revolution in user-generated information, online human networks, and
   rich human behavior-related data. However, the misuse of social
   technologies such as social media (SM) platforms, has introduced a new
   form of aggression and violence that occurs exclusively online. A new
   means of demonstrating aggressive behavior in SM websites are
   highlighted in this paper. The motivations for the construction of
   prediction models to fight aggressive behavior in SM are also outlined.
   We comprehensively review cyberbullying prediction models and identify
   the main issues related to the construction of cyberbullying prediction
   models in SM. This paper provides insights on the overall process for
   cyberbullying detection and most importantly overviews the methodology.
   Though data collection and feature engineering process has been
   elaborated, yet most of the emphasis is on feature selection algorithms
   and then using various machine learning algorithms for prediction of
   cyberbullying behaviors. Finally, the issues and challenges have been
   highlighted as well, which present new research directions for
   researchers to explore.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the dark side of news
   community forums: the proliferation of opinion manipulation trolls. In
   particular, it explores the idea that a user who is called a troll by
   several people is likely to be one. It further demonstrates the utility
   of this idea for detecting accused and paid opinion manipulation trolls
   and their comments as well as for predicting the credibility of comments
   in news community forums.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors are aiming to build a classifier
   to distinguish trolls vs regular users. Unfortunately, it is not easy to
   get reliable training data. The authors solve this issue pragmatically:
   the authors assume that a user who is called a troll by several people
   is likely to be such, which are called accused trolls. Based on this
   assumption and on leaked reports about actual paid opinion manipulation
   trolls, the authors build a classifier to distinguish trolls vs regular
   users.
   Findings The authors compare the profiles of paid trolls vs accused
   trolls vs non-trolls, and show that a classifier trained to distinguish
   accused trolls from non-trolls does quite well also at telling apart
   paid trolls from non-trolls.
   Research limitations/implications The troll detection works even for
   users with about 10 comments, but it achieves the best performance for
   users with a sizable number of comments in the forum, e.g. 100 or more.
   Yet, there is not such a limitation for troll comment detection.
   Practical implications The approach would help forum moderators in their
   work, by pointing them to the most suspicious users and comments. It
   would be also useful to investigative journalists who want to find paid
   opinion manipulation trolls.
   Social implications The authors can offer a better experience to online
   users by filtering out opinion manipulation trolls and their comments.
   Originality/value The authors propose a novel approach for finding paid
   opinion manipulation trolls and their posts.},

Abstract = {A knowledge-based methodology is proposed for the identification of type
   and level of violence presented implicitly in shared comments on social
   media. The work was focused on the semantic processing taking into
   account the content and handling comments as excerpts of knowledge. Our
   approach implements similarity measures, conceptual distances, graph
   theory algorithms, knowledge graphs and disambiguation processes.
   The methodology is composed for four stages. In the (1) ``knowledge base
   construction{''} the types and levels of violence are described as well
   as the knowledge graphs' administration. Mechanisms of inclusion and
   extraction were developed for the knowledge base's handling and content
   understanding. The (2) ``social media data collection{''} retrieves
   comments and maps the social graph's structure. In the (3) ``knowledge
   processing stage{''} the comments are transformed to formal
   representations as extracts of knowledge (graphs). Finally in the (4)
   ``violence domain identification{''} the comments are classified by
   their type and level of violence. The evaluation was carried out
   comparing our methodology with the baselines: (1) a dataset with
   comments labeled by crowdFlower users, (2) news from social network
   Twitter, (3) a similar research and (4) typical lexical matching.},

   classification models generalize across datasets?},

Abstract = {A considerable body of research deals with the automatic identification
   of hate speech and related phenomena. However, cross-dataset model
   generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two
   still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization
   depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training
   data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of
   the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer
   (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained
   on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels
   are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra-and cross-dataset
   setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from
   model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ?toxic?,
   ?abusive?, or ?offensive?) serve better as cross-dataset training
   categories than others (e.g., ?hate speech?). To answer (ii), we use a
   Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and
   dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT,
   450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language
   classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a
   model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario.
   Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for
   the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and
   target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Online platforms are nurturing social interactions, yet regrettably,
   they have also led to the proliferation of antisocial behaviors such as
   cyberbullying, trolling, and hate speech on a global scale. The
   identification of hate speech and aggression has become indispensable in
   the fight against cyberbullying and online harassment. Cyberbullying
   encompasses the use of aggressive and offensive language, including
   rude, insulting, hateful, and teasing comments, to inflict harm on
   individuals through social media platforms. Human moderation is both
   sluggish and costly, rendering it impractical in light of the
   exponential growth of data. Consequently, automated detection systems
   are imperative to effectively combat trolling. This study addresses the
   challenge of automatically discerning cyberbullying in tweets sourced
   from a publicly available cyberbullying dataset. The proposed
   methodology leverages the robustly optimized bidirectional encoder
   representations from transformers approach (RoBERTa), integrating
   principle component analysis (PCA) extracted global vectors for word
   representation (GLOVE) word embedding features. Furthermore, our
   proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art machine
   learning, deep learning, and transformer-based methods, utilizing the
   GLOVE word embedding technique. Statistical analyses reveal that our
   proposed model outperforms its counterparts, achieving a 0.98 accuracy
   and recall rate with 0.97 of precision and F1 score in detecting
   cyberbullying tweets. Results from k-fold cross validation further
   corroborate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

Abstract = {Microaggressions describe subtle often offensive comments or actions
   made by one individual to another. Typically, such comments or actions
   are made subconsciously with the offender potentially unaware of the
   impacts on the recipient. Currently, machine learning methods for racial
   microaggression detection are sparse with no. one, comparable approach
   to the one we propose further on. Automated detection in this work
   describes the method of finding microaggressions through the use of
   machine-learning algorithms. Efforts have been made for the detection of
   hate speech and harassment; providing us with a rather humble place to
   begin, as we explore further, such methods are proven ineffective. We
   propose a step forward in solving this problem with the demonstration of
   an automated racial microaggression detection method. Whilst racial
   hatespeech detection method provides us with an idea as to where we can
   start, we find further on, that microaggressions and hatespeech use very
   different features to portray their sentiment. This work aims to provide
   a technical review which explores the understanding of the automated
   racial microaggression detection, outlining the definitions of
   microaggressions currently described in the literature, with the
   presentation and assessment (through precision, callback and F-measure)
   of a promising approach in regards to racial microaggression detection.
   We also intend to analyse a case study in which we detect the presence
   of racial microaggressions within new reports with the intention of
   laying a foundation for the potential security-related applications of
   this work. Our further works begin to discuss this notion in a higher
   level of detail.},

Abstract = {Researchers can evaluate numerous information to ensure automated
   monitoring due to the widespread use of surveillance cameras in smart
   cities. For the monitoring of violence or abnormal behaviors in smart
   cities, schools, hospitals, residences, and other observational domains,
   an enhanced safety and security system is required to prevent any
   injuries that might result in ecological, economic and social losses.
   Automatic detection for prompt actions is vital and may help the
   respective departments effectively. Based on thermal imaging, several
   researchers have concentrated on object detection, tracking, and action
   identification. Few studies have simultaneously extracted
   spatial-temporal information from a thermal image and utilized it to
   recognize human actions. This research provides a novelty based on
   frame-level and spatial and temporal features which combines richer
   context temporal information to address the issue of poor efficiency and
   less accuracy in detecting abnormal/violent behavior in thermal
   monitoring devices. The model can locate (bounded box) video frame areas
   involving different human activities and recognize (classify) the
   actions. The dataset on human behavior includes videos captured with
   infrared cameras in both indoor and outdoor environments. The
   experimental results using the publicly available benchmark datasets
   reveal the proposed model's efficiency. Our model achieves 98.5\% and
   94.85\% accuracy on IITR Infrared Action Recognition (IITR-IAR) and
   Thermal Simulated Fall (TSF) datasets, respectively. In addition, the
   proposed method may be evaluated in more realistic conditions, such as
   zooming in and out etc.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there are numerous social platforms for people to discuss and
   share information. However, certain users may post contents that
   discriminate against specific groups or spread inappropriate behaviors.
   Therefore, it is desired to have a detection mechanism that is able to
   accurately identify these offensive comments and inappropriate messages
   before appearing on social platforms. To address this need, we propose a
   novel model called Attention-based Multi-filter Convolutional Neural
   Network (AMCNN) for inappropriate speech detection. Our model combines
   CNN and BiLSTM to acquire the advantages of the two. AMCNN leverages CNN
   filters of various kernel sizes for convolution operations to capture
   the relation between words of different lengths. The convolutional
   features are then used as the inputs of BiLSTM, which is able to obtain
   the bidirectional semantics via the forward and backward directions.
   AMCNN further incorporates the attention mechanism to highlight the
   important parts of the hidden layer output for better classification.
   Our model can be applied to various types and lengths of text, and it is
   also able to support different languages. To evaluate the model
   performance, we conduct extensive experiments on various real-world
   datasets. According to the experimental results, our model achieves the
   best performance, which is on average 12.63\% higher than the
   state-of-the-art approach on the F1-score indicator. We also conduct
   ablation analysis, and the results show that the attention mechanism and
   the usage of BiLSTM can considerably improve the classification
   performance and effectively detect inappropriate speech in sentences.},

Abstract = {Online hate speech, particularly over microblogging platforms like
   Twitter, has emerged as arguably the most severe issue of the past
   decade. Several countries have reported a steep rise in hate crimes
   infuriated by malicious hate campaigns. While the detection of hate
   speech is one of the emerging research areas, the generation and spread
   of topic-dependent hate in the information network remain
   under-explored. In this work, we focus on exploring user behavior, which
   triggers the genesis of hate speech on Twitter and how it diffuses via
   retweets. We crawl a large-scale dataset of tweets, retweets, user
   activity history, and follower networks, comprising over 161 million
   tweets from more than 41 million unique users. We also collect over 600k
   contemporary news articles published online. We characterize different
   signals of information that govern these dynamics. Our analyses
   differentiate the diffusion dynamics in the presence of hate from usual
   information diffusion. This motivates us to formulate the modeling
   problem in a topic-aware setting with real-world knowledge. For
   predicting the initiation of hate speech for any given hashtag, we
   propose multiple feature-rich models, with the best performing one
   achieving a macro F1 score of 0.65. Meanwhile, to predict the retweet
   dynamics on Twitter, we propose RETINA, a novel neural architecture that
   incorporates exogenous influence using scaled dot-product attention.
   RETINA achieves a macro F1-score of 0.85, outperforming multiple
   state-of-the-art models. Our analysis reveals the superlative power of
   RETINA to predict the retweet dynamics of hateful content compared to
   the existing diffusion models.},

Abstract = {Wikipedia, the free and open-collaboration based online encyclopedia,
   has millions of pages that are maintained by thousands of volunteer
   editors. As per Wikipedia's fundamental principles, pages on Wikipedia
   are written with a neutral point of view and maintained by volunteer
   editors for free with well-defined guidelines in order to avoid or
   disclose any conflict of interest. However, there have been several
   known incidents where editors intentionally violate such guidelines in
   order to get paid (or even extort money) for maintaining promotional
   spam articles without disclosing such.
   In this paper, we address for the first time the problem of identifying
   undisclosed paid articles in Wikipedia. We propose a machine
   learning-based framework using a set of features based on both the
   content of the articles as well as the patterns of edit history of users
   who create them. To test our approach, we collected and curated a new
   dataset from English Wikipedia with ground truth on undisclosed paid
   articles. Our experimental evaluation shows that we can identify
   undisclosed paid articles with an AUROC of 0.98 and an average precision
   of 0.91. Moreover, our approach outperforms ORES, a scoring system tool
   currently used by Wikipedia to automatically detect damaging content, in
   identifying undisclosed paid articles. Finally, we show that our
   user-based features can also detect undisclosed paid editors with an
   AUROC of 0.94 and an average precision of 0.92, outperforming existing
   approaches.},

Title = {HateFusion: Harnessing Attention-Based Techniques for Enhanced Filtering
   and Detection of Implicit Hate Speech},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 18},
Abstract = {Hate speech is a complex, multifaceted form of harmful material that
   targets individuals or groups. Detecting implicit hate speech poses a
   significant challenge due to its subtle expressions and the critical
   role of context in its identification. In response to this challenge, we
   have fine-tuned BERT and DistilBERT models on three publicly available
   datasets: Toxigen, Implicit Gab, and the Implicit Hate Corpus (IHC). Our
   approach involves meticulous data preprocessing, customized model
   configurations, and strategic hyperparameter optimization, all tailored
   to enhance the models' performance in binary, 3-way, and 7-way implicit
   hate detection. We observed notable improvements in the detection
   capabilities of our proposed work. To enhance the explainability of
   model behavior, we visualized attention mechanisms, including attention
   heads and compatibility scores, using tools such as BertViz, local
   interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and Shapley additive
   explanations (SHAP). This facilitated the clear interpretation of model
   decisions. We developed a software application called HateFusion, which
   integrates our fine-tuned models with an intuitive graphical interface.
   The application includes a flagging option that allows users or
   moderators to mark highly hateful content, supporting continuous model
   refinement and updates. Our proposed model achieved the highest
   macro-weighted F1 scores across multiple datasets. On the IHC dataset
   (for 2-, 3-, and 7-way classification tasks), it achieved F1 scores of
   0.75, 0.73, and 0.61 with DistilBERT, and 0.77, 0.72, and 0.60 with
   BERT. On the Toxigen (2-way) and ImpGab (3-way) datasets, it scored 0.77
   and 0.89 with DistilBERT, and 0.82 and 0.89 with BERT, respectively.},

Title = {A framework for detecting fighting behavior based on key points of human
   skeletal posture},
Journal = {COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {248},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Detecting fights from videos and images in public surveillance places is
   an important task to limit violent criminal behavior. Real-time
   detection of violent behavior can effectively ensure the personal safety
   of pedestrians and further maintain public social stability. Therefore,
   in this paper, we aim to detect real-time violent behavior in videos. We
   propose a novel neural network model framework based on human pose key
   points, called Real-Time Pose Net (RTPNet). Utilize the pose extractor
   (YOLO-Pose) to extract human skeleton features, and classify video level
   violent behavior based on the 2DCNN model (ACTION-Net). Utilize
   appearance features and inter frame correlation to accurately detect
   fighting behavior. We have also proposed a new image dataset called VIMD
   (Violence Image Dataset), which includes images of fighting behavior
   collected online and captured independently. After training on the
   dataset, the network can effectively identify skeletal features from
   videos and locate fighting movements. The dataset is available on GitHub
   (https://github.com/ChinaZhangPeng/Violence-Image-Dataset). We also
   conducted experiments on four datasets, including Hockey-Fight,
   RWF-2000, Surveillance Camera Fight, and AVD dataset. These experimental
   results showed that RTPNet outperformed the most advanced methods in the
   past, achieving an accuracy of 99.4\% on the Hockey-Fight dataset,
   93.3\% on the RWF-2000 dataset, and 93.4\% on the Surveillance Camera
   Fight dataset, 99.3\% on the AVD dataset. And with speeds capable of
   reaching 33fps, state-of-the-art results are achieved with faster
   speeds. In addition, RTPNet can also have good detection performance in
   violent behavior in complex backgrounds.},

Abstract = {With the recent rise in violent crime, the real-time situation analysis
   capabilities of the prevalent closed-circuit television have been
   employed for the deterrence and resolution of criminal activities.
   Anomaly detection can identify abnormal instances such as violence
   within the patterns of a specified dataset; however, it faces challenges
   in that the dataset for abnormal situations is smaller than that for
   normal situations. Herein, using datasets such as UBI-Fights, RWF-2000,
   and UCSD Ped1 and Ped2, anomaly detection was approached as a binary
   classification problem. Frames extracted from each video with annotation
   were reconstructed into a limited number of images of 3x3, 4x3, 4x4, 5x3
   sizes using the method proposed in this paper, forming an input data
   structure similar to a light field and patch of vision transformer. The
   model was constructed by applying a convolutional block attention module
   that included channel and spatial attention modules to a residual neural
   network with depths of 10, 18, 34, and 50 in the form of a
   three-dimensional convolution. The proposed model performed better than
   existing models in detecting abnormal behavior such as violent acts in
   videos. For instance, with the undersampled UBI-Fights dataset, our
   network achieved an accuracy of 0.9933, a loss value of 0.0010, an area
   under the curve of 0.9973, and an equal error rate of 0.0027. These
   results may contribute significantly to solve real-world issues such as
   the detection of violent behavior in artificial intelligence systems
   using computer vision and real-time video monitoring.},

Abstract = {Children are the most vulnerable to ideas presented in Cartoon videos
   and TV. Cartoons have become one of the most important source of
   entertainment, but it also introduce a lot of ideas that are not
   suitable for them. Violence is one of the unwanted feature that is
   prevalent in cartoons to put element of fantasy and enchantment. In
   order to stop children from viewing violent intense cartoons, the best
   strategy is to make them inaccessible. Therefore, some sort of filters
   should be placed at certain hubs to perform this task. The challenge is
   that how a filter will know that a particular cartoon video has violent
   content in it. The meta-data telling the world about the video does not
   inform that the video consists of violent material. Certain
   frames/snapshots/images of video, if analyzed using image processing
   techniques, can help in concluding that a particular video has intense
   material in it. The aim of this work is to classify social media videos
   especially related to animated cartoons with violent / nonviolent
   behaviors. It addresses the problem of content based image matching
   algorithms based on key point descriptors. The basic goal is to extract
   general information from an image without any specific query. First
   SIFT-descriptors are extracted from a large set of images. This set of
   descriptors are then defined as a means of providing fast and accurate
   comparisons between images and distinguish between violent and
   nonviolent images in combination with Machine Learning algorithms. The
   results are then compared for each classifier with varying parameters.},

Title = {Probabilistic Modeling for Frequency Vectors Using a Flexible
   Shifted-Scaled Dirichlet Distribution Prior},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA},

Abstract = {Burstiness and overdispersion phenomena of count vectors pose
   significant challenges in modeling such data accurately. While the
   dependency assumption of the multinomial distribution causes its failure
   to model frequency vectors in several machine learning and data mining
   applications, researchers found that by extending the multinomial
   distribution to the Dirichlet Compound multinomial (DCM), both phenomena
   modeling can be addressed. However, Dirichlet distribution is not the
   best choice, as a prior, given its negative-correlation and
   equal-confidence requirements. Thus, we propose to use a flexible
   generalization of the Dirichlet distribution, namely, the shifted-scaled
   Dirichlet, as a prior to the multinomial, which grants the model a
   capability to better fit real data, and we call the new model the
   Multinomial Shifted-Scaled Dirichlet (MSSD). Given that the likelihood
   function plays a key role in statistical inference, e.g., in maximum
   likelihood estimation and Fisher information matrix investigation, we
   propose to improve the efficiency of computing the MSSD log-likelihood
   by approximating its function based on Bernoulli polynomials where the
   log-likelihood function is computed using the proposed mesh algorithm.
   Moreover, given the sparsity and high-dimensionality nature of count
   vectors, we propose to improve its computation efficiency by
   approximating the novel MSSD as a member of the exponential family of
   distribution, which we call EMSSD. The clustering is based on mixture
   models, and for learning a model, selection approach is seamlessly
   integrated with the estimation of the parameters. The merits of the
   proposed approach are validated via challenging real-world applications
   such as hate speech detection in Twitter, real-time recognition of
   criminal action, and anomaly detection in crowded scenes. Results reveal
   that the proposed clustering frameworks offer a good compromise between
   other state-of-the-art techniques and outperform other approaches
   previously used for frequency vectors modeling. Besides, comparing to
   the MSSD, the approximation EMSSD has reduced the computational
   complexity in high-dimensional feature spaces.},

Abstract = {The use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems is widespread in all
   areas where serious safety concerns exist. Keeping an eye on things
   manually sounds like a timeconsuming and challenging process.
   Identifying theft, detecting aggression, detecting explosive risks, etc
   ., are all circumstances in which the term ``security{''}takes on
   multiple meanings. When applied to crowded public spaces, the phrase
   ``security{''}encompasses nearly every conceivable kind of abnormality.
   Detecting violent behaviour among them is challenging since it typically
   occurs in a group setting. Several practical limitations make it hard,
   though complex functional limitations make it difficult to analyze crowd
   film scenes for anomalous or aberrant behaviour. This article provides a
   broad overview of the field, starting with object identification and
   moving on to action recognition, crowd analysis, and violence detection
   in a crowd setting. By combining you only look once (YOLO) with transfer
   learning, the model may acquire new skills from various sources. This
   makes it more flexible for use in various object identification
   applications and lessens the time and effort required to gather large
   annotated datasets. This article proposes the YOLO model with transfer
   learning for intelligent surveillance in Internet of Thing (IoT)-enabled
   home environments in smart cities. Quantization concepts are being
   applied to optimize the YOLO model in this work. Using YOLO with
   quantization, the model is optimized for use on edge devices and mobile
   platforms, which have limited computing capabilities. Thus, even with
   limited technology, object detection systems may be used in various real
   -world applications. The proposed model has been validated on two
   different datasets of 7,382 images. The proposed model gains an accuracy
   level of 98.27\%. The proposed method outperforms the conventional one.
   The use of the YOLO model and transfer learning with quantization has
   significant potential for enhancing ecological smart city monitoring,
   and further research and development in this area could contribute to
   developing more effective and efficient environmental smart city
   monitoring systems.},

Title = {Exhaustive Study into Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for
   Multilingual Cyberbullying Detection in Bangla and Chittagonian Texts},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is a serious problem in online communication. It is
   important to find effective ways to detect cyberbullying content to make
   online environments safer. In this paper, we investigated the
   identification of cyberbullying contents from the Bangla and
   Chittagonian languages, which are both low-resource languages, with the
   latter being an extremely low-resource language. In the study, we used
   both traditional baseline machine learning methods, as well as a wide
   suite of deep learning methods especially focusing on hybrid networks
   and transformer-based multilingual models. For the data, we collected
   over 5000 both Bangla and Chittagonian text samples from social media.
   Krippendorff's alpha and Cohen's kappa were used to measure the
   reliability of the dataset annotations. Traditional machine learning
   methods used in this research achieved accuracies ranging from 0.63 to
   0.711, with SVM emerging as the top performer. Furthermore, employing
   ensemble models such as Bagging with 0.70 accuracy, Boosting with 0.69
   accuracy, and Voting with 0.72 accuracy yielded promising results. In
   contrast, deep learning models, notably CNN, achieved accuracies ranging
   from 0.69 to 0.811, thus outperforming traditional ML approaches, with
   CNN exhibiting the highest accuracy. We also proposed a series of hybrid
   network-based models, including BiLSTM+GRU with an accuracy of 0.799,
   CNN+LSTM with 0.801 accuracy, CNN+BiLSTM with 0.78 accuracy, and CNN+GRU
   with 0.804 accuracy. Notably, the most complex model, (CNN+LSTM)+BiLSTM,
   attained an accuracy of 0.82, thus showcasing the efficacy of hybrid
   architectures. Furthermore, we explored transformer-based models, such
   as XLM-Roberta with 0.841 accuracy, Bangla BERT with 0.822 accuracy,
   Multilingual BERT with 0.821 accuracy, BERT with 0.82 accuracy, and
   Bangla ELECTRA with 0.785 accuracy, which showed significantly enhanced
   accuracy levels. Our analysis demonstrates that deep learning methods
   can be highly effective in addressing the pervasive issue of
   cyberbullying in several different linguistic contexts. We show that
   transformer models can efficiently circumvent the language dependence
   problem that plagues conventional transfer learning methods. Our
   findings suggest that hybrid approaches and transformer-based embeddings
   can effectively tackle the problem of cyberbullying across online
   platforms.},

Abstract = {Air-to-Ground Situation Assessment (SA) requires gathering information
   on the entities evolving on the ground (e. g., people, vehicles), and
   inferring the relations among them and their final intent. Several
   airborne sensor data might concur in the compilation of such high-level
   picture, which is aimed at identifying threats and promptly raising
   alarms. However, this process is intrinsically prone to errors: as the
   evidence - provided to the SA algorithm - originates from noisy sensor
   observations, the final outcome is also affected by uncertainty.
   High-level inferred variables, such as ``Situation{''} and ``Threat
   Level{''}, can be seen as error-affected, incomplete estimates of the
   ground truth, hence they are subject to improvement by properly steering
   the data acquisition process. In this paper we address the problem of
   optimizing the air route of the sensing platform, in order to reduce the
   number of false declarations or the delay in threat declaration in the
   SA stage. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting a hostile
   behavior between pairs of ground targets by exploiting track data
   generated from airborne bearings-only measurements. We model the
   optimization problem with a sequential Markov Decision Process (MDP):
   the platform sequentially selects the best maneuver (i.e., its
   acceleration vector) in order to maximize the total reward over an in
   finite horizon. We de fine the potential contribution of an action as a
   function of the expected environmental conditions (e.g., obscurations of
   the line-of-sight) and the improvement of the localization accuracy
   achievable for the tracked objects. We demonstrate that following the
   optimized trajectory the delay in the declaration of a hostile behavior
   between two targets is reduced at the same erroneous declaration rate.},

Abstract = {Abnormal or violent behavior by people with mental disorders is common.
   When individuals with mental disorders exhibit abnormal behavior in
   public places, they may cause physical and mental harm to others as well
   as to themselves. Thus, it is necessary to monitor their behavior using
   visual surveillance systems. However, it is challenging to automatically
   detect human abnormal behavior (especially for individuals with mental
   disorders) based on motion recognition technologies. To address these
   issues, in the current work, we propose an end-to-end abnormal behaviour
   detection framework from a new perspective in conjunction with the Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network
   (3DCNN). Specifically, we first train a one-class classifier to extract
   features and estimate abnormality scores. To improve the performance of
   abnormal behavior detection, GCN is used to model the similarity between
   video clips for the correction of noisy labels. Then, based on this
   framework, GCN recognizes the normal behavior clips in the abnormal
   video and removes them, while the clips identified as abnormal behavior
   are retained. Finally, a 3D CNN is used to extract spatiotemporal
   features to classify different abnormal behaviors. In order to better
   detect the violent behavior of individuals with mental disorders, the
   paper focuses on the UCF-Crime dataset with various types of violent
   behaviors. By experimenting with this dataset, the classification
   accuracy reaches 37.9\%, which is significantly better than that of the
   current state-of-the-art approaches.},

Abstract = {Moderators often face a double challenge regarding reducing offensive
   and harmful content in social media. Despite the need to prevent the
   free circulation of such content, strict censorship on social media
   cannot be implemented due to a tricky dilemma - preserving free speech
   on the Internet while limiting them and how not to overreact. Existing
   systems do not essentially exploit the correlatedness of hate-offensive
   content and aggressive posts; instead, they attend to the tasks
   individually. As a result, the need for cost-effective, sophisticated
   multi-task systems to effectively detect aggressive and offensive
   content on social media is highly critical in recent times. This work
   presents a novel multifaceted transformer-based framework to identify
   aggressive and hate posts on social media. Through an end-to-end
   transformer-based multi-task network, our proposed approach addresses
   the following array of tasks: (a) aggression identification, (b)
   misogynistic aggression identification, (c) identifying hate-offensive
   and non-hate-offensive content, (d) identifying hate, profane, and
   offensive posts, (e) type of offense. We further investigate the role of
   emotion in improving the system's overall performance by learning the
   task of emotion detection jointly with the other tasks. We evaluate our
   approach on two popular benchmark datasets of aggression and hate
   speech, covering four languages, and compare the system performance with
   various state-of-the-art methods. Results indicate that our multi-task
   system performs significantly well for all the tasks across multiple
   languages, outperforming several benchmark methods. Moreover, the
   secondary task of emotion detection substantially improves the system
   performance for all the tasks, indicating strong correlatedness among
   the tasks of aggression, hate, and emotion, thus opening avenues for
   future research.},

Abstract = {The paper presumes that social media is an environment where local and
   small events may escalate into bigger and even global ones in a very
   short period of time. This is because social media offers opportunities
   for discussion of shared interest in way which cannot be controlled:
   everything that can be exposed will be exposed - for all intents and
   purposes. This possibility has also changed the landscape of discussions
   of controversial issue, such as foreign and security policy. Compared to
   traditional mass media, social media enable disclosing opinions without
   censorship. Nowadays people have access to online discussions, blogs and
   even websites entirely devoted to sharing negative information. It has
   been seen that, during crisis situations social media has become a major
   way of affecting people's opinions. Consequently we are witnessing the
   rise of trolls - individual who shares inflammatory, extraneous or
   off-topic messages in social media, with the primary intent of provoking
   readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal
   on-topic discussion. Based on the lack of censorship, on the one hand,
   and trolling behavior, on the other, the paper aims to understand the
   rise and diffusion of extreme opinions in Twitter. This is a case study
   paper, where the analysed case is Twitter messages on Ukrainian crisis
   during 2014 written in Finnish language. The aim is to utilize sentiment
   analysis for the automatic detection of trolling behavior. Sentiment
   analysis provides tools for strategic communications for the automatic
   analysis of social media discussions and to recognize opportunities for
   participating in the discussion at the most effective stage.},

Title = {Homophobic and Hate Speech Detection Using Multilingual-BERT Mode on
   Turkish Social Media},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {356-375},
Abstract = {Homophobic expressions are a form of insulting the sexual orientation or
   personality of people. Severe psychological traumas may occur in people
   who are exposed to this type of communication. It is important to
   develop automatic classification systems based on language models to
   examine social media content and distinguish homophobic discourse. This
   study aims to present a pre-trained Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers (M-BERT) model that can successfully
   detect whether Turkish comments on social media contain homophobic or
   related hate comments (i.e., sexist, severe humiliation, and defecation
   expressions). Comments in the Homophobic-Abusive Turkish Comments (HATC)
   dataset were collected from Instagram to train the detection models. The
   HATC dataset was manually labeled at the sentence level and combined
   with the Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) dataset that has developed in
   our previous study. The HATC dataset has been balanced using the
   resampling method and two forms of the dataset (i.e., resHATC and
   original HATC) were used in the experiments. Afterward, the M-BERT model
   was compared with DL-based models (i.e., Long-Short Term Memory,
   Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit),
   Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifiers (i.e., Support Vector
   Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and Ensemble Classifiers (i.e.,
   Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting) for the
   best model selection. The performance of the detection models was
   evaluated using F1-score, precision, and recall performance metrics.
   Results showed the best performance (homophobic F1-score: 82.64\%,
   hateful F1-score: 91.75\%, neutral F1-score: 96.08\%, average F1-score:
   90.15\%) were achieved with the M-BERT model on the HATC dataset. The
   M-BERT detection model can increase the effectiveness of filters in
   detecting Turkish homophobic and related hate speech in social networks.
   It can be used to detect homophobic and related hate speech for
   different languages since the M-BERT model has multilingual pre-trained
   data.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms generate a huge amount of data every day.
   However, liberty of speech through these networks could easily help in
   spreading hatred. Hate speech is a severe concern endangering the
   cohesion and structure of civil societies. With the increase in hate and
   sarcasm among the people who contact others over the internet in this
   era, there is a dire need for utilizing artificial intelligence (AI)
   technology innovation that would face this problem. The rampant spread
   of hate can dangerously break society and severely damage marginalized
   people or groups. Thus, the identification of hate speech is essential
   and becoming more challenging, where the recognition of hate speech on
   time is crucial in stopping its dissemination. The capacity of the
   Arabic morphology and the scarcity of resources for the Arabic language
   makes the task of distinguishing hate speech even more demanding. For
   fast identification of Arabic hate speech in social network comments,
   this work presents a comprehensive framework with eight machine learning
   (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, namely Gradient Boosting (GB),
   K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB),
   Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
   Ara-BERT, and BERT-AJGT are implemented. Two representation techniques
   have been used in the proposed framework in order to extract features: a
   bag of words followed by BERT-based context text representations. Based
   on the result and discussion part, context text representation
   techniques with Ara-BERT and BERT-AJGT outperform all other ML models
   and related work with accuracy equal to 79\% for both models.},

Abstract = {Hate speech, offensive language, sexism, racism, and other types of
   abusive behavior have become a common phenomenon in many online social
   media platforms. In recent years, such diverse abusive behaviors have
   been manifesting with increased frequency and levels of intensity, e.g.,
   {[}9]. Despite social media's efforts to combat online abusive behaviors
   {[}23, 33] this problem is still apparent. In fact, up to now, they have
   entered an arms race with the perpetrators, who constantly change
   tactics to evade the detection algorithms deployed by these platforms.
   Such algorithms, not disclosed to the public for obvious reasons, are
   typically custom-designed and tuned to detect only one specific type of
   abusive behavior, but usually miss other related behaviors. In the
   present paper, we study this complex problem by following a more
   holistic approach, which considers the various aspects of abusive
   behavior. We focus on Twitter, due to its popularity, and analyze user
   and textual properties from different angles of abusive posting
   behavior. We propose a deep learning architecture, which utilizes a wide
   variety of available metadata, and combines it with
   automatically-extracted hidden patterns within the text of the tweets,
   to detect multiple abusive behavioral norms which are highly
   inter-related. The proposed unified architecture is applied in a
   seamless and transparent fashion without the need for any change of the
   architecture but only training a model for each task (i.e., different
   types of abusive behavior). We test the proposed approach with multiple
   datasets addressing different abusive behaviors on Twitter. Our results
   demonstrate high performance across all datasets, with the AUC value to
   range from 92\% to 98\%.},

Title = {Asian hate speech detection on Twitter during COVID-19},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in late
   2019, and after being utterly contagious in Asian countries, it rapidly
   spread to other countries. This disease caused governments worldwide to
   declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the
   speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of
   millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs
   experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns
   about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the
   aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against
   Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An
   analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study
   of Hate \& Extremism at California State University shows that
   Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by
   149\% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans'
   hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to
   balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of
   tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through
   the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of
   that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this
   article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated
   by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using
   this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various
   machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods
   include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine
   (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression,
   Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic
   Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional
   LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset
   by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low
   Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that
   Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning
   performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best
   performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.},

Title = {Applying machine learning to assess emotional reactions to video game
   content streamed on Spanish Twitch channels},
Journal = {COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This research explores for the first time the application of machine
   learning to detect emotional responses in video game streaming channels,
   specifically on Twitch, the most widely used platform for broadcasting
   content. Analyzing sentiment in gaming contexts is difficult due to the
   brevity of messages, the lack of context, and the use of informal
   language, which is exacerbated in the gaming environment by slang,
   abbreviations, memes, and jargon. First, a novel Spanish corpus was
   created from chat messages on Spanish video game Twitch channels,
   manually labeled for polarity and emotions. It is noteworthy as the
   first Spanish corpus for analyzing social responses on Twitch. Secondly,
   machine learning algorithms were used to classify polarity and emotions
   offering promising evaluations. The methodology followed in this work
   consists of three main steps: (1) Extracting Twitch chat messages from
   Spanish streamers' channels related to gaming events and gameplays; (2)
   Processing and selecting the messages to form the corpus and manually
   annotating polarity and emotions; and (3) Applying machine learning
   models to detect polarity and emotions in the created corpus. The
   results have shown that a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from
   Transformers (BERT) based model excels with 78\% accuracy in polarity
   detection, while deep learning and Random Forest models reach around
   70\%. For emotion detection, the BERT model performs best with 68\%,
   followed by deep learning with 55\%. It is worth noting that emotion
   detection is more challenging due to the subjective interpretation of
   emotions in the complex communicative context of video gaming on
   platforms such as Twitch. The use of supervised learning techniques,
   together with the rigorous corpus labeling process and the subsequent
   corpus pre-processing methodology, has helped to mitigate these
   challenges, and the algorithms have performed well. The main limitations
   of the research involve category and video game representation balance.
   Finally, it is important to stress that the integration of machine
   learning in video games and on Twitch is innovative, by allowing the
   identification of viewers' emotions on streamers' channels. This
   innovation could bring benefits such as a better understanding of
   audience sentiment, improving content and audience retention, providing
   personalized recommendations and detecting toxic behavior in chats.},

Title = {Ar-PuFi: A short-text dataset to identify the offensive messages towards
   public figures in the Arabian community},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {233},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The fight against offensive speech on the Internet necessitates
   increased efforts from linguistic analysis and artificial intelligence
   perspectives to develop countermeasures and preventive methods. Reliable
   predictions can only be obtained if these methods are exposed to a
   representative sample of the domain or environment under consideration.
   Datasets serve as the foundation for significant developments in this
   field because they are the main means of obtaining appropriate instances
   that reveal the multiple and varied faces of the offensive speech
   phenomenon. In this sense, we present Ar-PuFi, a dataset of offensive
   speech towards Public Figures in the Arabian community. With 24,071
   comments collected from TV interviews with Egyptian celebrities
   belonging to six domains of public interest, Ar-PuFi is currently the
   largest Arabic dataset in terms of its category and size. The examples
   were annotated by three native speakers over the course of two months
   and are provided with two-class and six-class annotations based on the
   presence or absence of explicit and implicit offensive content. We
   evaluated the performance of a diverse set of classification models
   employing several text representations of actual examples (e.g., N-gram,
   TF/IDF, AraVec, and fastText), and AraBERT achieved the baseline for the
   new dataset in both offensive detection and group classification.
   Additionally, we apply the Pointwise Mutual In-formation (PMI) technique
   to comments within the target domain in order to derive a lexicon of
   offensive terms associated with each domain of ArPuFi. We further
   explored whether active learning (AL) or meta-learning (ML) frameworks
   could be used to reduce the labeling effort required for our dataset
   without affecting prediction quality and found that, though AL can
   reduce the amount of data annotations by 10\% over the ML approach,
   neither approach requires less than about 70\% of the full dataset to
   achieve baseline performance. Finally, we took advantage of the
   availability of relevant datasets and conducted a cross-domain
   experiment to back up our claims not only about the uniqueness of our
   dataset but also about the difficulty of adapting Arabic dialects
   against one another.},

Title = {Abusive and Hate speech Classification in Arabic Text Using Pre-trained
   Language Models and Data Augmentation},

Abstract = {Hateful content on social media is a worldwide problem that adversely
   affects not just the targeted individuals but also anyone whose content
   is accessible. The majority of studies that looked at the automatic
   identification of inappropriate content addressed the English language,
   given the availability of resources. Therefore, there are still a number
   of low-resource languages that need more attention from the community.
   This article focuses on the Arabic dialect, which has several
   specificities that make the use of non-Arabic models inappropriate. Our
   hypothesis is that leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs)
   specifically designed for Arabic, along with data augmentation
   techniques, can significantly enhance the detection of hate speech in
   Arabic mono- and multi-dialect texts. To test this hypothesis, we
   conducted a series of experiments addressing three key research
   questions: (RQ1) Does text augmentation enhance the final results
   compared to using an unaugmented dataset? (RQ2) Do Arabic PLMs
   outperform other models utilizing techniques such as fastText and AraVec
   word embeddings? (RQ3) Does training and fine-tuning models on a
   multilingual dataset yield better results than training them on a
   monolingual dataset? Our methodology involved the comparison of PLMs
   based on transfer learning, specifically examining the performance of
   DziriBERT, AraBERT v2, and BERT-base-arabic models. We implemented text
   augmentation techniques and evaluated their impact on model performance.
   The tools used included fastText and AraVec for word embeddings, as well
   as various PLMs for transfer learning. The results demonstrate a notable
   improvement in classification accuracy, with augmented datasets showing
   an increase in performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and
   F1-score) by up to 15-21\% compared to non-augmented datasets. This
   underscores the potential of data augmentation in enhancing the models'
   ability to generalize across the nuanced spectrum of Arabic dialects.},

Abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have achieved state-of-art results on
   single text classification tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion
   detection, etc. However, the performance is achieved by testing and
   reporting on resource-rich languages like English. Applying GCN for
   multi-task text classification is an unexplored area. Moreover, training
   a GCN or adopting an English GCN for Indian languages is often limited
   by data availability, rich morphological variation, syntax, and semantic
   differences. In this paper, we study the use of GCN for the Telugu
   language in single and multi-task settings for four natural language
   processing (NLP) tasks, viz. sentiment analysis (SA), emotion
   identification (EI), hate-speech (HS), and sarcasm detection (SAR). In
   order to evaluate the performance of GCN with one of the Indian
   languages, Telugu, we analyze the GCN based models with extensive
   experiments on four downstream tasks. In addition, we created an
   annotated Telugu dataset, TEL-NLP, for the four NLP tasks. Further, we
   propose a supervised graph reconstruction method, Multi-Task Text GCN
   (MT-Text GCN) on the Telugu that leverages to simultaneously (i) learn
   the low-dimensional word and sentence graph embeddings from
   word-sentence graph reconstruction using graph autoencoder (GAE) and
   (ii) perform multi-task text classification using these latent sentence
   graph embeddings. We argue that our proposed MT-Text GCN achieves
   significant improvements on TEL- NLP over existing Telugu pretrained
   word embeddings {[}1], multilingual pretrained Transformer models: mBERT
   {[}2], and XLM-R {[}3]. On TEL- NLP, we achieve a high F1-score for four
   NLP tasks: SA (0.84), EI (0.55), HS (0.83) and SAR (0.66). Finally, we
   show our model's quantitative and qualitative analysis on the four NLP
   tasks in Telugu. We open-source our TEL-NLP dataset, pretrained models,
   and code (1).},

Abstract = {The escalating prevalence of online cyberbullying and trolling across
   various social media platforms has becomes a pressing concern. Extensive
   research demonstrates the detrimental impact of cyberbullying on the
   mental well-being of its victims. Given the sheer volume of online
   content, manual identification of cyberbullying instances proves
   unfeasible, necessitating the development of automated cyberbullying
   detection methods. This challenge has attracted considerable attention
   within the natural language processing (NLP) community, owing to
   advancements in machine learning techniques. However, most of the
   methods fail to provide reasoning for their decisions which warrants the
   use of interpretable models that can explain the model's output in
   real-time. Interpretable models rather than black-box models with high
   performance are becoming popular adhering the ``right to
   explanations{''} laws. Motivated by this, we create a cyberbullying
   corpus BullyExplain in code-mixed language, where a post has been
   annotated with four labels, i.e., bully, sentiment, target, and
   rationales (explainability). Current work addresses the task of
   explainable cyberbully detection and proposes a unified generative
   framework, BullyGen by redefining this multitask problem as a
   text-to-text generation task. Our framework is capable of not only
   detecting whether the text is a cyberbully or not but also provides
   reasoning by predicting rationale, target group and sentiment of the
   text. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed model
   by outperforming the state-of-the-art and several baselines by a
   significant margin and conclude that text-to-text generation model could
   be a good alternative for multitask classification problems.},

Title = {Leveraging fusion of sequence tagging models for toxic spans detection},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {500},
Pages = {688-702},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {The upsurge of prolific blogging and microblogging platforms enabled the
   abusers to spread negativity and threats greater than ever. Negative and
   hateful comments are averting users from sharing their opinion freely on
   social media platforms. It often breaks people's confidence and causes
   extensive damage to their mental health. Hence, identifying these toxic
   contents and taking appropriate measures against them is crucial to
   preserve a safe environment on social media. Numerous state-of-the-art
   approaches classify the whole content as toxic or non-toxic, but they
   don't distinguish the precise toxic portion from the whole content.
   Detecting the toxic portions is essential as it substantially aids to
   moderate the toxic contents through excluding the abusive parts. This
   paper describes our proposed approach to detect the toxic portions from
   text contents efficiently and accurately. We explore an ensemble of
   sequence labeling models including the word embedding-based Spark NLP
   NER (named entity recognition) deep learning model, spaCy NER model with
   custom toxic tags, and ALBERT NER model to identify the toxic spans. The
   NER-based models usually intend to capture the contextual attributes of
   phrases and spans that are essential for named entity recognition. As
   the toxic span detection task also requires us to apprehend the phrasal
   context for detecting toxic span, the similarity between these two tasks
   inspires us to exploit these NER models. Finally, we determine the final
   toxic spans using a prevalence-based fusion of the predictions generated
   by these models. The fusion strategy enables us to consolidate the
   diversity of these models for perceiving the phrasal context in all
   aspects. Experimental results achieved on the SemEval2021 toxic spans
   detection dataset depict that our model meticulously captures the toxic
   fragment and achieves a competitive result among the other
   state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {While social media platforms play an important role in our daily lives
   in obtaining the latest news and trends from across the globe, they are
   known to be prone to widespread proliferation of harmful information in
   different forms leading to misconceptions among the masses. Accordingly,
   several prior works have attempted to tag social media posts with
   labels/classes reflecting their veracity, sentiments, hate content, and
   so on. However, in order to have a convincing impact, it is important to
   additionally extract the post snippets on which the labelling decision
   is based. We call such a post snippet the rationale. These rationales
   significantly improve human trust and debuggability of the predictions,
   especially when detecting misinformation or stigmas from social media
   posts. These rationale spans or snippets are also helpful in
   post-classification social analysis, such as for finding out the target
   communities in hate-speech, or for understanding the arguments or
   concerns against the intake of vaccines. Also it is observed that a post
   may express multiple notions of misinformation, hate, sentiment, and the
   like. Thus, the task of determining (one or multiple) labels for a given
   piece of text, along with the text snippets explaining the rationale
   behind each of the identified labels is a challenging multi-label,
   multi-rationale classification task, which is still nascent in the
   literature. While transformer-based encoder-decoder generative models
   such as BART and T5 are well suited for the task, in this work we show
   how a relatively simpler encoder-only discriminative question-answering
   (QA) model can be effectively trained using simple template-based
   questions to accomplish the task. We thus propose MuLX-QA and
   demonstrate its utility in producing (label, rationale span) pairs in
   two different settings: multiclass (on the HateXplain dataset related to
   hate speech on social media), and multi-label (on the CAVES dataset
   related to COVID-19 anti-vaccine concerns). MuLX-QA outperforms heavier
   generative models in both settings. We also demonstrate the relative
   advantage of our proposed model MuLX-QA over strong baselines when
   trained with limited data. We perform several ablation studies, and
   experiments to better understand the effect of training MuLX-QA with
   different question prompts, and draw interesting inferences.
   Additionally, we show that MuLX-QA is effective on social media posts in
   resource-poor non-English languages as well. Finally, we perform a
   qualitative analysis of our model predictions and compare them with
   those of our strongest baseline.},

Abstract = {The study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of various
   machine learning (ML) classifiers in the context of detecting
   cyber-trolling behaviors. With the rising prevalence of online
   harassment, developing effective automated tools for aggression
   detection in digital communications has become imperative. This research
   assesses the efficacy of Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine
   (LightGBM), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive
   Bayes classifiers in identifying cyber troll posts within a publicly
   available dataset. Each ML classifier was trained and tested on a
   dataset curated for the detection of cyber trolls. The performance of
   the classifiers was gauged using confusion matrices, which provide
   detailed counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and
   false negatives. These metrics were then utilized to calculate the
   accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to better understand each
   model's predictive capabilities. The Random Forest classifier
   outperformed other models, exhibiting the highest accuracy and balanced
   precision-recall trade-off, as indicated by the highest true positive
   and true negative rates, alongside the lowest false positive and false
   negative rates. LightGBM, while effective, showed a tendency towards
   higher false predictions. Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes
   displayed identical confusion matrix results, an anomaly suggesting
   potential data handling or model application issues that warrant further
   investigation. The findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble
   methods, with Random Forest leading in the cyber troll detection task.
   The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate ML
   algorithms for text classification tasks in social media contexts and
   emphasizes the need for further scrutiny into the anomaly observed among
   the Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes results. Future work will
   focus on exploring the reasons behind this occurrence and the potential
   of deep learning techniques in enhancing detection performance.},

Abstract = {The competence of any online Web site depends on the type of experience
   it gives to its users, which depends largely on the content they put up
   on their Web site. Hence, the content which is being put online should
   be really taken care. There are many Web sites that provide content to
   their user in terms of questions and answers, for example, the online
   Web site Quora, which has large scale of data in terms of questions and
   answers of users. Users are the one who put up questions and also
   provide answers to those questions. In this paper, a system is proposed
   by considering significant amount of data from Kaggle, where it is
   utilized for different approaches to predict the insincere questions.
   The goal of the proposed work is to develop a model that considers
   question as an input in English language and produces output as either 0
   or 1. In that, 0 represents sincere type of questions and 1 represents
   insincere type of questions. Hence, the data are transformed into result
   including F1 score using preprocessing, 11-IDF and pre-trained word
   embedding. For each method, preprocessing tasks like tokenization, case
   normalization and punctuation removal are used. Each individual word
   after preprocessing is used as word vector in this work. These word
   vectors are then used for the insincere and sincere question
   classification which is given as input to the machine learning models
   like SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression and deep learning model
   called RNN with word embedding. It is used to detect the toxic content
   in the reviews as 1 for insincere and 0 for sincere questions. The
   accuracy of these different methods is critically examined with the help
   of LSTM, word embedding and model ensembling.},

Abstract = {The process of creating high-quality labeled data is crucial for
   training machine-learning models, but it can be a time-consuming and
   labor-intensive process. Moreover, manual annotation by human annotators
   can lead to varying degrees of competency, training, and experience,
   which can result in inconsistent labeling and arbitrary standards. To
   address these challenges, researchers have been exploring automated
   methods for enhancing training and testing datasets. This paper proposes
   SRL-ACO, a novel text augmentation framework that leverages Semantic
   Role Labeling (SRL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) techniques to
   generate additional training data for natural language processing (NLP)
   models. The framework uses SRL to identify the semantic roles of words
   in a sentence and ACO to generate new sentences that preserve these
   roles. SRL-ACO can enhance the accuracy of NLP models by generating
   additional data without requiring manual data annotation. The paper
   presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of SRL-ACO
   on seven text classification datasets for sentiment analysis, toxic text
   detection and sarcasm identification. The results show that SRL-ACO
   improves the performance of a classifier on different NLP tasks. These
   results demonstrate that SRL-ACO has the potential to enhance the
   quality and quantity of training data for various NLP tasks. (c) 2023

Abstract = {WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world. Due to its
   popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political
   campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election,
   where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with
   the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a
   breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and
   religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among
   the population about a specific (minority) community. According to
   research on inter-group conflict, such `fear speech' messages could have
   a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper,
   we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands
   of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new
   dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We
   observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and
   symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target
   community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that
   current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task.
   Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go
   undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due
   to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target

Title = {TCE-DBF: textual context enhanced dynamic bimodal fusion for hate video
   detection},
Journal = {DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {PurposeThe occurrence and dissemination of hate videos in social media
   platform could pose serious harm to both society and individuals.
   However, the characteristics of the hate videos increase the difficulty
   of detection task. Hate content is usually presented in a relatively
   covert manner in videos, and textual content in videos plays an
   important role in hate video detection. In this work, we propose a
   textual context enhanced dynamic bimodal fusion (TCE-DBF) method for
   hate video detection.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed method
   TCE-DBF introduces dynamic modality gate (DMG) and bimodal fusion
   transformer network to dynamically integrate multimodalities. Moreover,
   in order to enhance textual modality in videos, two types of textual
   context from the video are taken as the input of TCE-DBF. One is
   extracted from video frames in visual modality. The other is extracted
   from audio in acoustic modality. Specially, TCE-DBF splits the original
   audio and learns the sequence representation to capture acoustic
   temporal information.FindingsHate video detection has been one of the
   hotspots in recent works. However, it still faces two serious
   challenges. The first challenge is the hate content in videos presented
   in multimodalities. The second challenge is how to evaluate the
   importance of different modalities for multimodal fusion modeling.
   TCE-DBF aims to tackle these challenges. Experimental results on hate
   video dataset HateMM demonstrate that TCE-DBF outperforms the
   state-of-the-art methods, and the visualization results show that
   textual modality plays a more important role in hate video detection.
   Therefore, it is vital to consider the text in
   videos.Originality/valueTCE-DBF can be utilized to effectively detect
   hate videos on social media. Besides transcript, TCE-DBF considers text
   in video frames, which makes detection more accurate. Meanwhile, to
   better achieve multimodal fusion, TCE-DBF uses DMG and bimodal fusion
   transformer network to dynamically assign different weights to three
   modalities and integrate them. The proposed TCE-DBF is novel in terms of
   capturing multimodal features, enhancing the textual modality and
   achieving high detection performance for hate video detection.},

Title = {``The Enemy Among Us{''}: Detecting Cyber Hate Speech with Threats-based
   Othering Language Embeddings},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Offensive or antagonistic language targeted at individuals and social
   groups based on their personal characteristics (also known as cyber hate
   speech or cyberhate) has been frequently posted and widely circulated
   via the World Wide Web. This can be considered as a key risk factor for
   individual and societal tension surrounding regional instability.
   Automated Web-based cyberhate detection is important for observing and
   understanding community and regional societal tension-especially in
   online social networks where posts can be rapidly and widely viewed and
   disseminated. While previous work has involved using lexicons,
   bagsof-words, or probabilistic language parsing approaches, they often
   suffer from a similar issue, which is that cyberhate can be subtle and
   indirect -thus, depending on the occurrence of individual words or
   phrases, can lead to a significant number of false negatives, providing
   inaccurate representation of the trends in cyberhate. This problem
   motivated us to challenge thinking around the representation of subtle
   language use, such as references to perceived threats from ``the
   other{''} including immigration or job prosperity in a hateful context.
   We propose a novel ``othering{''} feature set that utilizes language use
   around the concept of ``othering{''} and intergroup threat theory to
   identify these subtleties, and we implement a wide range of
   classification methods using embedding learning to compute semantic
   distances between parts of speech considered to be part of an
   ``othering{''} narrative. To validate our approach, we conducted two
   sets of experiments. The first involved comparing the results of our
   novel method with state-of-the-art baseline models from the literature.
   Our approach outperformed all existing methods. The second tested the
   best performing models from the first phase on unseen datasets for
   different types of cyberhate, namely religion, disability, race, and
   sexual orientation. The results showed F-measure scores for classifying
   hateful instances obtained through applying our model of 0.81, 0.71,
   0.89, and 0.72, respectively, demonstrating the ability of the
   ``othering{''} narrative to be an important part of model
   generalization.},

Title = {Enhancement of a multi-dialectal sentiment analysis system by the
   detection of the implied sarcastic features},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {227},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Sentiment analysis is an NLP task that gained the interest of many
   researchers in various languages and recently in the Arabic language. We
   have encountered several challenges when dealing with this task,
   including sarcasm detection. In this article, we aim to exploit
   sarcastic characteristics to improve the accuracy of the sentiment
   analysis system. Sarcasm is difficult to detect because it is implicit
   and characterized by the presence of positive words in a negative
   context. We have then extracted a variety of features to define context
   incongruity and the opposition between the objective and subjective
   sentences. Offensive language and hate speech correspond to expressions
   that hurt others. The detection of offensive language is based on
   identifying offensive terms that are strongly negative and helpful to
   detect negative expressions. Thus, we have manually and automatically
   constructed sentimental, offensive and sarcastic lexicons and collected
   others. In the same way, many corpora either ironic (sarcastic,
   offensive) or sentimental (positive, negative) were collected. As
   sarcasm is a major challenge for the sentiment analysis system, we have
   built a balanced system that contains positive and negative (sarcastic,
   offensive) tweets. Since the analyzed corpus is multidialectal, we have
   used a cross dialect lexicon that retains meaning when passing from one
   dialect to another. Besides the Arabic dialect common characteristics,
   the classification was enhanced by the detection of the specificities of
   some dialects that use negation clitics as well as negation words to
   negate a term. The experiments prove that the enhancement of a sentiment
   analysis system by sarcastic features improved the results by 8\% to
   reach 84.17\% of accuracy using a classical machine learning approach
   and 80.36\% using a Deep learning approach. The classical machine
   learning approach is improved afterward based on the expansion of the
   BOW lexicon and the reduction of the characteristic vector to reach an
   accuracy of 89.24\%. This method is multilingual because the built model
   can be language independent. Indeed, it is enough to have the
   corresponding resources to apply the system to other languages. (C) 2021

Abstract = {The safety of people's lives and property is the primary factor for the
   success of urban construction. Therefore, in order to better maintain
   social stability and harmony, relying on computer technology to
   effectively detect violence and to make decision support has important
   theoretical and practical significance. Aiming at the shortcomings of
   traditional manual design feature extraction methods, this paper
   proposes a super automatic violence detection method based on the
   combination of Deep Learning and trajectory in AI systems. Firstly,
   aiming at the problem of complex time and high accuracy of traditional
   manual feature extraction, a deep spatiotemporal violence detection
   method based on three-dimensional convolution and trajectory in AI
   systems is proposed. We improve the IDT algorithm to extract the target
   trajectory, and carry out three-dimensional convolution and pooling
   operation to calculate the deep-seated temporal and spatial information
   in the video frame, so as to realize peer-to-peer detection in AI
   systems. Secondly, in order to further improve the acquired deep-seated
   time and space information and utilization rate and achieve high
   detection rate, the feature fusion of double stream convolution and
   threedimensional convolution is proposed, and the feature extraction of
   continuous video frame sequence is carried out by three-dimensional
   convolution neural network (C3D), which can effectively extract the
   fusion feature information of time and space in the classification
   layer, so as to obtain the final classification result. Finally, in
   order to solve the problem of too deep network level and slow
   convergence, dense convolution is introduced, which reduces the
   parameters of the network model and time complexity. Experimental
   results show that compared with other mainstream algorithms, this method
   is more effective and stable, and can be applied to the detection of
   violent abnormal behavior in video. Meanwhile, the method proposed in
   this paper has important theoretical value and practical significance
   for decision support of video surveillance system in AI systems.},
